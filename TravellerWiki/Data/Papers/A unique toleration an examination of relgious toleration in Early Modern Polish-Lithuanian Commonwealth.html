<p>By 1573 Europe had been ravaged by the wars of religion – word of
such horrors as the St. Bartholomew’s Days massacre spread throughout
continent. In the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania,
the shared nobles sought to protect their power, and their own religious
freedom from the same fate as was met by religious minorities in France
and elsewhere. To do this, the nobles of the two countries worked
together to form the Warsaw Confederation. Inspired by the Peace of
Augsburg, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth would embrace religious
freedom for its nobles to the degree that “if one were to look for
[religious] toleration in Western Europe before the 1680s … One would
look to the east: to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in its glory
days after the Confederation of Warsaw in 1573.”<a href="#fn1"

<p>This paper will examine the topic of religious tolerance in the
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. It will do this by examining if
religious toleration was present in the Commonwealth, why this religious
toleration developed in the Commonwealth, and what the role of the
Catholic Church and Catholicism as a whole were in the evolution of
religious toleration in the Commonwealth. However, it should be noted
that the sources on this topic which are available in English are
limited, which has made drawing a conclusion on the extent to which
religious toleration existed and the role of the Catholic Church
difficult.</p>
<p>In the early modern period, religious toleration was the exception
and not the rule across Europe; and yet for the Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth, this was not the case, in large part due to the diversity
of religion present in the Commonwealth at its inception. Poland had
been converted to Catholicism during the reign of Duke Mieszko in the
10<sup>th</sup> century.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The 11<sup>th</sup> century saw
Jewish people becoming a permanent fixture in Poland, and by the
13<sup>th</sup> century the followers of the Jewish religion had been
granted “self government, a separate legal status, and freedom of
faith”.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> In the 13<sup>th</sup> century, King
Casimir the Great conquered Ruthenia which had historically followed the
Greek Orthodox tradition.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> He also arranged for the marriage of
his daughter Jadwiga of Anjou to Prince Jogaila of Lithuania, bringing
with him more Jewish people as well as many Muslims, and laying the
foundation of religious diversity so important for the development of
the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> After the Reformation
had begun, Poland became known as a safe haven for those who disagreed
with the Catholic Church. After the publication of Martin Luther’s
Ninety-five Theses, his works were found in the largest cities of
Poland, which motivated protestant groups like the Bohemian Brethren to
move to Poland: “In the Kingdom of Poland, with its long borders and
diverse population, Orthodox, Jews, and Muslims could live in peace as
well.”<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>In late January 1573, fearing the spread of the religious wars in
Germany to their lands, the nobility in their Sejm (the equivalent to
Parliament) enacted the <em>Pax Dissidentium</em>, which identified all
religious groups – including Catholics – which differed in faith as
<em>dissidenties</em>, and granted them complete legal equality with the
Catholic Church.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> There was, however, a clause which
gave nobles the ability to decide over their subjects in matters of
religion, thus limiting the extent of religious liberties for the common
person.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> This widespread religious diversity,
combined with the power of the nobility, and the size of the
Commonwealth made it all but inevitable that “the early
[Polish-Lithuanian] state [was] forced to accept a kind of religious
coexistence.”<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> However, these factors still do not
fully explain the course which led to the development of religious
toleration as it appeared in the Confederation.</p>
<p>Religious toleration as it appeared in the Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth was due to two major factors: the spread of Protestantism
among the nobility, gentry, and middle class; and the development of the
Sejm as a representative institution for the nobility.</p>
<p>The high point of Protestantism in Poland was around 1570, as in that
period 700 places of Protestant worship existed, and of the various
social classes, half of the nobility had converted to Protestantism, a
quarter of the gentry and towns folk had converted, and around five
percent of the peasant class had converted – meaning that Protestantism
was dominated by the nobility and middle classes, while being in the
minority in society.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Most of the nobles and gentry who
adopted the Protestant faith had come from Little Poland and Lithuania,
though Lutheranism spread among the German speaking nobles and gentry in
Greater Poland and Royal Prussia.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> When nobles went to
study abroad they learned of social and religious issues leading to
their conversion.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> For those of the gentry who were
interested in Protestantism, the University of Krakow offered a haven
for their studies.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Those in the gentry who became
interested in Protestantism reached this position due to strong beliefs
in the moral degeneracy of clerics and the hypocrisy of the Catholic
Church.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Those nobles who did not convert
still expressed normal medieval anti-clerical views as well as a
resentment against a rival power group in the Catholic Church.<a
href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>As Protestantism spread, it began to have an effect on the royal
finances, leading to “[King Sigismund Augustus]’s policy of allowing
full freedom of religion to Lutherans in Danzig, Thorn, and Elbing, in
1557/58, [which] was predicated neither upon altruism nor religious
relativism, but rather upon the king’s financial need.”<a href="#fn16"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>
However, during the 1560s Protestantism would also begin its fall, as it
lost the nine theological and noble people who acted as pillars of
support for the Protestant faith in Poland.<a href="#fn17"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
However, this decline would not become visible for decades, and
Protestantism was, at the dawn of the 1570s, a dominant power.<a
href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> The Polish Brethren, Lutherans and
The Reformed made an attempt to join together, and while nothing would
come of <em>that</em> union, it laid the foundation for the creation of
the Warsaw Confederation three years later in 1573.<a href="#fn19"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
As the years went on, the greatest continued supporters of Protestantism
would be the gentry and middle class in Greater Poland.<a href="#fn20"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The spread of Protestantism is just one piece of the development of
religious toleration; the other much more important piece is the
politics of the nobility, and how they used the assurance of religious
toleration – among other clauses – as a secondary assurance of noble
authority over the King. The first steps for the development of the
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth’s elected kingship and Sejm can be found
in the reign of King Casimir the Great, who lacked his own male heir and
chose to allow the nobility to have a voice in determining his
successor.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> The groups agreed to the oldest
daughter of the King of Hungary, Louis of Anjou; following the death of
King Casimir, the nobility instead chose to accept a younger daughter of
Louis’ Jadwiga, who then married Jagillo Duke of Lithuania and who was
later recognized as King of Poland, and who would extend the rights and
prerogatives of the Polish nobility to the nobles in Lithuania.<a
href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> Over the next century the nobility
would continue to expand their rights until they had gained control over
the entirety of the legislative branch; these rights applied “whether
rich or poor, landed or landless, rural or urban, all nobles were
legally the same.”<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> This allowed the Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth to have the largest political class in Europe at that time,
composed of six to seven percent of the population.<a href="#fn24"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>This large political class expressed its desire for religious liberty
in 1552 during a Sejm, during which the nobility questioned the
authority of the bishops, deciding that: “no one but the monarch had the
right to judge citizen and to condemn them to any penalty what so ever,”
eventually agreeing that the clergy only had power in matters of
religion, and none in civil or political life.<a href="#fn25"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>
This was expanded on during a Sejm in 1556 to guarantee everyone the
right to worship as one wished.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> By the late 1550s the
Protestants nearly had a majority in the Sejm, however it was split
among various Protestant sects.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> One of the large draws
of Protestantism for poor nobles who lacked land was to act as “a
powerful weapon in [their] pursuit against the privilege and position of
the kings, the magnates, and the higher clergy.”<a href="#fn28"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
This is why the agreement made between various Protestant groups in 1570
was important: it allowed the groups to create a coalition in the Sejm
and in 1573 pass the <em>Pax Dissidentium</em>, and by extension create
the <em>Pacta Conventa</em> which Henry of Valois agreed to and which
granted religious toleration to the subjects of the Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>The role of the Catholic Church in the development of religious
toleration can best be described as antagonistic – the Church was not
happy about losing its hold over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
This was not practical for the rulers of Poland however, as: “the
weakness of royal authority and the political realism of Sigismund the
old – and eventually of Sigismund Augustus – led polish rulers to
conclude that social order was of higher value than religious unity”
which made it “clear that, had the power of the Church within the polity
or the authority of royal rule within the kingdom been sufficient and
greater, dissent, heterodoxy, heresy, and Christian diversity would not
have been tolerated to the degree they were.”<a href="#fn30"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>
However that is not to say that the Church and Kings did not try. For
example King Sigismund the Old was staunchly Catholic, supported
Catholic Church reform, and was deeply hostile to the Reformation, going
so far as to ban importation of Luther’s books under threat of
confiscation and banishment.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> However, he was
unwilling to arrest and execute heretics even when urged to do so by a
papal envoy.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> His son, King Sigismund II Augustus
cared little for religion, but was a conservative and traditionalist,
which kept him in the Catholic faith, but said of others’ religions: “I
am not the king of your consciences,” and it was during his reign that
Protestantism reached its peak in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.<a
href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> As a result of King Sigismund
Augustus’ toleration, Henry of Valois was forced to sign the <em>Pacta
Conventa</em>, which was “an international treaty concluded between
Charles IX and the Polish and Lithuanian Estates; it was an agreement
between the new king and his subjects, wherein certain obligations made
by Henry were enumerated”, including religious toleration.<a
href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> However, the Warsaw Confederation’s
religious tolerations were weak in application due to Catholic
resistance, and its protections of freedom of religion would last for
around a century as a result of class solidarity.<a href="#fn35"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Class solidary from the nobility would not prevent the Church from
“[unleashing] a strong counter-campaign excommunicating many clergy and
noblemen, condemning them to death and confiscating their property.”<a
href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> Rome opposed and censured the
<em>Pax dissidentium</em>, and the Catholic Church’s primary supporter,
Cardinal Stanislaus Hosius, recommended that King Henry of Valois
retract his oath of religious tolerance, and invited the Jesuits to
Poland.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> The Jesuits would truly begin their
anti-protestant campaign after the end of Henry de Valois time reigning
over Poland.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> To achieve these ends, they used
“brute physical force, gaining control over education, destroying the
concept of law and individual rights, replacing them with prejudice and
corruption, and supporting aggression against Protestants.”<a
href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> However, the most common methods
used to convert people were: “giving talks that extolled study in
catholic Academic Centers, using wives and friends to apply pressure,
and encouraging new converts to influence others,” and the most
important reason for peoples’ conversion was “fear of pulling the
commonwealth into the religious wars, a lack of strong political
groupings in Polish dissent circles, the lack of widespread support for
the slogans of the Reformation, disillusionment with the never-ending
conflicts, and opportunism.”<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> These issues, combined
with the actions of the Jesuits meant that in the latter half of the
17<sup>th</sup> century, the Catholic Church was able to gain greater
control over the country, preventing departures from the faith under
threat of expulsion from the country.<a href="#fn41"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>
By “1717, the last non-Catholics were removed from all offices and
titles.”<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was a unique state in the early
modern period, as a result of its large size and the way in which it had
grown to be contain a religiously diverse population. As well, due to
several instances where kings were left without male heirs, the nobility
was able to gain control over the legislative branch of the
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth’s government, and due to their desire to
hold onto power, they enacted protections for religious freedoms.
However, as class solidarity declined, the Catholic Church was able to
convert Protestants to Catholicism, and as the Catholics, supported by
the Jesuits, gained power, the now Catholic-dominated nobility acted to
remove the religious liberties that their predecessors had fought so
hard to attain.</p>
