<p>One system to organize and integrate the readings covered during the
Winter Semester would be following the economic evolution of Latin
America during the 20<sup>th</sup> century, subsequent to the Great
Depression. This would allow reader to gain a deeper understanding of
the economic impacts on the governments of Latin American counties, the
rise and impact of US economic imperialism on Latin America, and the
effects of the economic changes to various social groups. In essence it
would argue that the Great Depression laid a foundation which was built
on by the Cold War which created the conditions that the United States
could use to further exploit and effectively colonize the countries of
Latin America. As well, it would demonstrate that not even communist
Cuba could escape the economic imperialism of the United States and the
resulting inequality and social issues that went with it.</p>
<p>This organizational system is at its core economic, tracing the shift
from import substitution to neoliberalism. However, to explore the
impact of economic changes, it would also include social and political
history. This allows the reader to develop an understanding of the
relationship between a nation’s government, its people, and its economy.
As well, this system would demonstrate the relationship between the
economic imperialism of the United States, and its impact on those
living in the colonized areas, as well as the transnational nature of
Latin American history.</p>
<p>This paper will provide a broad overview of each of the readings in
this semester in the order they were read, discussing the core theme of
each, and how each would fit into this system of organization. Then it
will explain how the readings should be structured, why it should be
structured in that manner, and the benefits that manner of organization
offers.</p>
<p>The readings on the Great Depression explore the impacts of the Great
Depression on Latin America, arguing that South America’s experience of
the Great Depression was better than most countries in the developed
world, such as the United States.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> This is because this
period saw the shift in economic policy towards Import Substitution
Industrialization (ISI), which saw an expansion in exports, growth of
the middle class, and a rise in government control and involvement in
the economy.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> At the same time, the articles
discuss the impact of the depression on the working class, for whom it
was much worse than the middle or upper class – who did still experience
discomfort but to a lesser extent – leading to an increase in
radicalized people growing increasingly disenchanted with their
government, the wealthy land owners, and other elites.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> The
articles explain that countries like Mexico saw a rise in labor rights
and land redistribution during this period, demonstrating the impacts of
the Depression in the day to day lives of those living outside of urban
society.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> A secondary result of the Depression
was a rise in urbanization, as well as a rise in foreign ownership of
capital intensive industries, such as oil or the international fruit
trade. This is because oil required a large amount of capital to find
and extract the oil, and bananas require ships which could deliver on
time to the United States. As a result of the Great Depression, American
companies were able to enter countries like Colombia and use their
position to consolidate control over oil fields, and shipping fruit,
setting an early foundation for the economic imperialism of the United
States.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Finally, the readings on the Great
Depression also explore the racialized and gendered impact of the Great
Depression, establishing a baseline against which future developments in
those areas can be judged.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The next reading to look at is the reading on dictatorship and power
in the Caribbean. In <em>The</em> <em>Dictators Seduction</em> this
system would examine the impact of the rise of the Trujillo, following
the invasion of the Dominican Republic by the United States, to their
eventual leaving of the island, which in turn gave the American
marine-trained soldier Trujillo an opening to seize power.<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> At
roughly the same time, the first version of American post Great
Depression economic imperialism was introduced. This system was
established when the United States left the island but it continued to
flood the island with cheap duty-free products, as opposed to the common
shift in the Caribbean and Latin America to ISI.<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Examining Trujillo’s regime also acts as an early demonstration of
what would come in other Latin American countries: things such as the
repression of women, large scale state surveillance turning neighbor on
neighbor, with fear enforced by a secrete police force creating an
environment where distrust was common.<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
Another theme which the Trujillo years highlight is the relationship of
race in the Caribbean and South America, both in its vague, socially
defined composition, and in the impact it made on people’s day to day
lives. This can be seen in the article on the Hattian Massacre, which
demonstrates the way violence was used to create racism, the
relationship between race and class, and the way elites in Latin America
used racism as a justification for horrible events.<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
As well, by examining the Tigueraje archetype, other leaders and
nations’ gender structures can be compared and contrasted against it.<a
href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> For example, the Tiguearaje
archetype’s depicts as a positive symbol of masculinity the conquest of
women, something which would shift in Brazil and Argentina, the former
as rebellious sexually liberated resistance fighters and the latter as a
repressive pro family regime.</p>
<p>Examining another island in the Caribbean, the readings on Cuba
provide a very different point of view to which the rest of the readings
may be contrasted against. This is because from the United States’
perspective, Cuba was a threat just off their coast who defied American
imperialism by resisting the aggressive actions of the United States,
thus acting as a symbol of defiance which other nations could rally to
instead of the United States. An example of Cuba as a contrasting view
to other Latin American countries can be seen in the treatment of women,
where countries like the Dominican Republic sought to subjugate their
female citizens, and the southern cone sought to control and protect
them, Cuba tried to equalize them by requiring by law that household
labor be split equally, which saw some success in eroding hierarchies
which stood in other Latin American countries.<a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
However, the special period has seen a rise in prostitution and general
inequality.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> As well, the readings demonstrate
one path that a country which broke away from the United States could
take, while still being unable to fully escape the gravitational pull of
the free market backed by the United States without joining another,
further away, imperialist power in the Soviet Union.<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
In turn, as Cuba drifted from the American sphere of influence, leaders
in the United States became “[determined] to punish Cuba for the
transgressions of Fidel Castro,”<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> and by extension any
country which tried to follow in its footsteps.<a href="#fn16"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>
Finally, as Latin America enters its neoliberal period, the
transnational nature of Latin America can be demonstrated using Cuba,
which saw a rise in race-based issues during the country’s special
period, as businesses which worked with tourists preferred lighter
skinned employees.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Return to continental America, the readings on Latin America and the
Cold War examine the impact of the Cold War on Latin America,
demonstrating the reaction of the United States and the first steps in
its attempt to shore up support for itself within its sphere of
influence.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> To ensure that the United States
maintained control in Latin America, the CIA carried out ‘psy ops’ and
trained supportive regimes in how to prevent communists from taking over
the various Latin American countries, sometimes surpassing their
supposed ‘arms length’ assistance.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> An example of this is
Project Pedro in Mexico, which was an attempt to show American
propaganda as news reels, which ultimately failed due to funding issues,
and failed to achieve its goal, because it had to be made in line with
local cultural understandings and beliefs.<a href="#fn20"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>
As well, in the article looking at Brazil, the role of race and gender
are discussed, because the media created the image of Bonnie and Clyde,
turning blonde women into symbols of resistance.<a href="#fn21"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
At the same time, a more liberal view of sex was taking hold among those
rebelling against the Brazilian government, with a popular belief being
that resistance women were themselves more liberal in their
promiscuity.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>From the cultural Cold War, the readings move to the rise of the
military dictatorships themselves. Jerry Davila’s <em>Dictatorships in
South America</em> follow the rise of three southern cone dictatorships:
Argentina, Brazil, and Chile from the rise of the dictatorships to their
eventual fall. One theme which is highlighted with this reading is the
role economics had to play in the dictatorships, on the recovery of
which the dictatorships rested their legitimacy, embracing the
American-backed free market ideology, and support from the American
government in removing perceived subservices and those who challenged
the American-backed free market dictatorships.<a href="#fn23"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>
The book also examines the human impact of these regimes, the
disappearances and surveillance states which they created, the silent
suffering and fear being disappeared while living under those regimes.<a
href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> As well, the book examines Chile,
whose extreme embrace of the Free Market would be used as an example and
justification for other nations to follow suit. By examining Chile
specifically, the book is able to demonstrate the difference between the
previous socialist leader, removed from power by the United States, and
the face of the free market, Pinochet afterwards. In doing so, this
reading demonstrates the impact Cuba had on American foreign policy and
the fear of another country turning away from the United States towards
socialism.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Destape explores the return of democracy, and how in Argentina, after
the paternalistic Junta fell, there was an explosion of sexual content
and sexology everywhere in the average person’s life. In doing so, the
book demonstrates the success of the United States over the Soviet Union
in Latin America, as democracy came to be expressed through the
purchasing of sexual content. This reaffirmed the neoliberal idea that
democracy, freedom, and the free market go hand in hand.<a href="#fn26"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>
However the main argument of the book is that the destape was a period
where people fought for and articulated their sexual rights in a more
open environment. This demonstrates the shift in the popular
understanding of sex and the family, as men no longer feel required to
protect their wives and daughters from other men.<a href="#fn27"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>
This also demonstrates one of the positive changes resulting from the
decline and end of the Cold War, and shift from the United States-backed
repressive regime to a more open, United States supported, neoliberal
democracy, towards a more open society.<a href="#fn28"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
However, the book also demonstrates the limits of this newfound
openness, as it was limited to heterosexual people – it primarily
featured the sexualization of women for men - and as such did little to
advance the acceptance of LGBTQ+ groups within Argentinian society.<a
href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>The readings on democratization and human rights explore the downfall
of the repressive regimes and the struggle between different groups over
whose memory of what happened gets recorded. This generally meant
starting a Truth Commission with the goal of determining what happened
during the dictatorships, who was involved and who needs to be held
accountable.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> The articles explore the difficult
social impact of the disappearances, and holding those responsible
accountable, as in Argentina where there developed a difference between
the regime’s officers and those following orders, challenging the idea
from Nuremburg that ‘just following orders’ is not a valid defense for
all involved in the atrocities in Argentina.<a href="#fn31"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>The final set of readings complete the picture of the American
neoliberal conquest of Latin America. <em>Empire’s Workshop</em> traces
the rise of the United States as an imperial power forged in Latin
America based on neoliberalism, from the New Deal to the early
21<sup>st</sup> century.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> By following the rise
of the New Right, first created by the backlash from the defeat in
Vietnam, popularized with Reagan, and pushed to the extreme by Bush,
<em>Empire’s Workshop</em> offers a reflective look back at what was
covered in the course from the American point of view.<a href="#fn33"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>
The end result of this is the widespread push through the IMF and
acceptance of the American neoliberal ideology in Latin America.<a
href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> The failure of this is explored in
two articles, which demonstrate the rise in inequality which accompanied
the neoliberal period.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> The racial impact of neoliberalism
is demonstrated by the fact that on average white people came to live
longer, with better access to healthcare and education increasing the
chances of a positive outcome and was compounded on because those with
an education were able to emigrate to another country and remit money to
their families at home.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> There was also a gender divided
which is explored in these readings, though the outcomes here are much
more closely linked to class, and location. That is, predominantly urban
upper- and middle-class women were generally better educated and able to
enter the white-collar work force then their rural working-class
counterparts.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>This proposed system of organization has several advantages, most
importantly its focus on the relationship between the economy,
governments, and those impacted by these two factors, on the basis of
class, gender, race, or sexuality. It also demonstrates the different
forms of American imperialism, and the role it has played in the
development of the various Latin American countries examined throughout
these readings. For example, the United States abandonment of the
Dominican Republic leading to the rise of Trujillo, who was trained by
American marines, and similarities to the various governments supported
with CIA training after the 1960s. As well, the differences between
regimes, such as Brazil’s limited following of advice from the United
States compared to Argentina or Chile.</p>
<p>In order to best achieve this result, I propose the following
ordering of the readings. I would begin with the readings on the Great
Depression, as it offers an introduction to the area, and allows the
reader to gain an understanding of how the region develops over the
course of the Cold War. I would then follow this up with <em>Empire’s
Workshop</em>, whose broad overview provides a timeline to which the
other readings can be pegged, allowing the reader to better follow along
with the various developments explored in other readings, as well as
bringing the role of American economic imperialism front and center.
After <em>Empire’s Workshop</em> would come the readings on Cuba, as
this offers a contrasting perspective to the American objective in Latin
America. As well, it serves as an alternative angle from which the rest
of the readings can be viewed – one angle is the imposition of the
American neoliberal system onto Latin American countries, another is
Latin American countries fighting for the right to define their own path
forward. These readings, combined with <em>Empire’s Workshop</em>, build
on the themes established in the Great Depression readings by showing
the developments which shifted many countries from ISI towards an
American free market approach, and the reason for the violent opposition
to shifts towards neoliberalism. Before fully diving into the cold war,
I would then read <em>The Dictator’s Seduction</em>, as it showcases the
imperialist history of the United States in Latin America and the
Caribbean, and the development of many similar tactics to what would
later be seen in the southern cone during the Cold War, offering another
point of comparison, both against the revolution in Cuba which went an
entirely different direction. Here is an area where <em>Empire’s
Workshop</em> would provide value, as it offers the American argument
for why they went after Cuba but mostly ignored the Dominican Republic –
because Cuba was communist and the Dominican Republic friendly to the
United States.</p>
<p>With the foundation laid by the previous readings, I would then read
the works on the cultural Cold War, as they demonstrate the day-to-day
impact of the Cold War in people’s lives, as the effect of things like
the Cuban Revolution had on people in other counties. As well, it
demonstrates that the goal of the United States was not just economic
control, but complete economic, political, social, and military control
over the various southern cone regions in a vain attempt to keep
communism out. The impacts of the cultural cold war are explored in the
reading on the various dictatorships in Latin America, wherein the
rhetoric put forward by the United States met the reality of life in
Latin America. In this section I would again contrast these readings
with both the readings on the Dominican Republic, and <em>Empire’s
Workshop</em>. The former demonstrates the similarities and differences
between the governing regimes, and the effect of active support from the
United States in the Southern Cone, as opposed to the dispassionate
trade view seen in the Dominican Republic. Building on this reading
would be the readings on democracy and the fall of the regimes. This
shows the victory of the American neoliberal agenda in breaking down
popular resistance, as many countries would come to be pushed by the IMF
into embracing neoliberal policies, opening the countries’ now
privatized industries to investment from the companies of the United
States. As well, the struggles over how to remember what had occurred
during the regimes’ continuing battles established during the cultural
cold war. It also shows the importance of universal human rights, both
in removing the regimes and in recovering from their impact on
day-to-day life. Destape would be used as a case study to demonstrate
the impacts of this transition, as it demonstrates the merging of
economic and democratic ideas, as well as the fight for human rights by
various groups in Argentina, and the societal transformation which
occurred during the Destape because of the end of the dictatorship.
Finally, I would end with the readings on the impact of neoliberalism,
showing the impact of the corporate imperialism of the United States on
the various Latin American countries. In this I would include the
readings on race and inequality in Cuba. This is because it shows that
with the victory of the United States in the Cold War, no country in
Latin America could escape the effects of neoliberalism, as seen by
Cuba’s rising inequality and racial issues.</p>
<p>There are many ways the readings covered in the Winter Semester could
be organized. This paper argued that one such way would be as an
exploration of American economic imperialism, through the changes in
economic systems in Latin America over the course of the 20<sup>th</sup>
century, and examining the themes of economic, political, and social
impact of these changes as they evolved over time. As well, the proposed
method of organization offers two different points of view from which
various readings can be related back to, so as to explore the
aforementioned themes by comparing and contrasting different countries,
periods, and events.</p>
