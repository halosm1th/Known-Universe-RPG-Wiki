<p>It is said that in 988, while battling the Kherson, Prince Vladimir
of Kiev needed a sure way to turn a prolonged siege into a victory.
Vladimir heard about an arrow which an enemy sent into the Rus’ camp
which detailed a way to cut off the besieged city’s water. Vladimir
“raised his eyes to heaven and vowed that if this hope was realized, he
would be baptized.”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> He was a man of his word, and in the
Church of St. Basil it is said that Vladimir underwent his baptism and
accepted the tenets of Christianity, which Vladimir knew were the same
as those known by his wife, a Byzantine Princess – the tenets of the
Eastern Orthodox Church.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>This type of narrative is not uncommon in early-medieval history.
Many new Christian kings converted in the heat of battle, and because of
their wives. Vladimir’s tale is not only like that of the medieval
kings, but Vladimir’s conversion is perhaps even more divine than his
fellow leaders, as Vladimir’s has traces that could be seen as related
to Constantine the Great. Both Vladimir and Constantine converted
because of battle, both had important Christian women in their lives
named Helen who were important to their conversions, and like so many
other Christian rulers, the aristocracy of Vladimir’s court would follow
in their Prince’s footsteps.</p>
<p>However, if Vladimir is the one responsible for the Rus’ conversion
to Christianity, one might wonder why he is credited for the conversion
if Vladimir had a grandmother who once ruled the realm and who was a
pious Christian herself. Along the same line of reasoning, one may
wonder why so few sources, even those of the Byzantine Empire, make
important note of the conversion of the Rus’ to Christianity. This is
even more intriguing as in the text of a treaty made between the Rus’
and Byzantines in 945, i.e. before St. Olga had converted, there are
orders for how the Christians among the Rus’ were to take the treaty’s
oath.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>This paper sets out to consolidate information regarding the
questions left open by <em>The Russian Primary Chronical</em> regarding
the conversion of the Rus’ to Christianity. Specifically, it briefly
explores the connection between the early Rus’ converts, St. Olga, and
the conversion of the Rus’ under St. Vladimir. It will accomplish this
by examining a possible way in which the first Rus’ were christianized.
It will then briefly explain the significance of St. Olga, and how her
example as a wise ruler who saw how the separation between the Christian
family and the Rus’ fiefdom allowed her to protect the throne for her
son and lay a foundation for the later acceptance of Christianity under
Vladimir. The last area briefly explored is how Vladimir, or his
chronicler, was able to use these pieces – the early Christians, the
impact left by St. Olga, and Vladimir’s own political cunning – to meld
together the conversion myth presented in <em>The Russian Primary
Chronical</em>.</p>
<p>There are at least three prominent questions left open by the treaty
made in 945: who are the christian Rus’ mentioned in the treaty, who
converted them, and why are there no sources which tell of what
happened? The answer is twofold. There was a group of Slavs who were
converted to Christianity but who were not the Rus’, and the records of
their conversion were not kept due to the taint of heresy associated
with having been produced in the last period of iconoclastic
dispute.</p>
<p>The question of who converted the Rus’ is the easiest to answer. St.
Cyril was dispatched on a mission to convert pagans. While wintering in
Crimea, which had become a home to “recalcitrant popes … [and] a haven
to monks fleeing iconoclastic persecutions,”<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> St.
Cyril began preaching to the Slavic people who were there, as it is said
that “in 867 Patriarch Photius announced … that the “Godless Rus’” … had
accepted a bishop!”<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> However, given the many different
groups of nomadic peoples in Crimea at this time, and the distance
between Kiev and Crimea, it would be unlikely that the people St. Cyril
converted are the Kievan Rus’.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Most likely they were a different group of Rus’, possibly those who
were recorded to have attacked Constantinople in the early decades of
the 800s. The attackers were not the Kievan Rus’, as while the attack
was recorded in <em>The Russian Primary Chronical</em>, it was said to
have been led by a different group of non-Kievan Rus’.<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The
Byzantine records confirm an attack by the Rus’ with three leaders, one
of whom betrayed and beheaded the other two, and then gained what the
Rus’ report as great honours – most likely the conversion of the last
leader to Christianity.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> However, the record of this attack
in <em>The Russian Primary Chronical</em> works to avoid naming the
Emperor of that period, which may indicate that the chronicler might
have seen the person as a heretic. This heretic might have been John the
Grammarian, who had employed a similar plan in the conversion of the
Bulgarians, and who was Patriarch of Constantinople during the
iconoclastic period.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>This group may have been the same group of people St. Cyril preached
to in Crimea. St. Cyril listened to a group in Crimea discuss the merits
of the region’s three largest religions: Islam, Judaism, and
Christianity. The group is entranced with St. Cyril’s explanation of
Christianity, comparing it to a bitter medicine.<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
It is also said that those who agreed with St. Cyril had previously had
good relations with the empire in the east, and knew of the supremacy of
that empire’s emperor, and “professed Christianity with a remarkable
credo”.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> This is made more clear “when [the
groups] first counsellor and ‘all the people’ pledged their adherence to
Christianity” to which St. Cyril responded “with tears in his eyes”
calling the group “brothers, fathers, friends and people.”<a
href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> This embrace of new converts, and
their understanding of Christianity may mean these were the Rus’ who had
agreed to conversion years before. This would explain why Patriarch
Photius did not see what St. Cyril was doing as a new conversion, but
merely a continuation of something which had been started under
iconoclasts, and to avoid crediting the heretics with some good, the
importance of this rediscovery is not made more apparent in Byzantine
sources.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, one explanation of who were the Christians mentioned in the
treaty made in 940 is that they are the remnants of those converted by
St. Cyril in Crimea, those who had been first converted under an
Iconoclast Patriarch, and thus had their initial conversion lost in the
attempt to discredit the heretics. These individuals who are folded into
the greater Rus’ nation were simply not important enough to be able to
convince those in positions of power to convert or had lost their nation
which had once been converted, and now made up a small group within a
new greater nation.</p>
<p>Several years later, after the death of her husband, and with a son
who, due to his young age was unable to assume his responsibilities as
leader, St. Olga was forced to step up and become regent, leader of the
Rus’. Because of her sex, St. Olga was not able to lead the Rus’ in
battle, and instead used her brilliant intellect and verbal skills to
protect the nation.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> She was not the first barbarian
ruler to be baptized, but she most likely was the first female regent or
ruler to have been baptized.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Her conversion was
impactful for several reasons, most importantly here are the example of
her cunning and intellect when she subverts the Byzantine Emperor’s
request for marriage, while refusing to bring the Rus’ nation into the
greater Byzantine Empire.</p>
<p>The display of St. Olga’s cunning and intellect comes from her
reported subversion of the Emperor’s desire to marry through her
knowledge of Christian law immediately after her conversion. The Emperor
is said to have wanted to marry Olga but could not as she was a pagan.
The Emperor convinced Olga to convert to Christianity, offering to be
her godfather. However, at that time, it was against Christian belief
for a godparent to marry their godchild;<a href="#fn16"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>
through this loophole, Olga was able to avoid marriage, and protect her
lands for her son, while also converting to Christianity. However,
during Olga’s conversion she was careful to listen to the Patriarch, and
treat him with great respect, which showed Olga’s respect for her new
faith even while acting as a nation’s leader.<a href="#fn17"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
This sets the foundation for the Rus’ idea of subservience to the Greek
Church, but not the Byzantine Empire, to which they were instead an
ally. This is illustrated by the term which the Rus’ used in
translations: “Greki”, instead of the Byzantines preferred term:
“Rhomanioi”.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> The example set by St. Olga would
later be a part of the justification used by the nobility when
convincing Vladimir to convert to Christianity.<a href="#fn19"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>And it would be under St. Olga’s grandson, St. Vladimir, that the
rest of the Rus’ would follow her footsteps and convert to Eastern
Christianity. Following the death of Vladimir’s father in 971 during his
defeat at Silistria, the Rus’ were thrown into turbulent times. Vladimir
began to search for stability and respectability which he believed could
be found in religion.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Vladimir first tried Rus’ paganism,
but it was not a success, resulting in Vladimir dispatching various
people to examine the religions of nearby empires.<a href="#fn21"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
The reports came back offering various reasons why Islam and Western
Christianity were less desirable than Eastern Christianity. Around the
same period, Vladimir also has great men from three religions brought
in: Eastern Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. Vladimir quickly dismissed
Islam and Judaism but listened to a wise philosopher explain the merits
of Eastern Christianity. After these events Vladimir agreed with the
merits of the Eastern Church but was unwilling to convert at that
time.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p><em>The Russian Primary Chronical</em> attempts to make the
conversion to Eastern Christianity an obvious choice and, given the
close relationship between the Byzantines and the Rus’, and the earlier
conversion of Olga, this is not surprising. The choice to convert to
Eastern Christianity was not however as obvious as it may first appear.
Most of the Rus’ elite had no issue with the Western teachings, and Olga
herself had asked Otto I to send a western missionary bishop and priests
to her land.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> As well, the Rus’ were proud to be
independent from the Byzantines, and so did not share in the Byzantine
hostility to the Western Church.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Another possible reason for the discrepancy is that the story is not
entirely accurate. <em>The Russian Primary Chronical</em> itself was
written well over one hundred years after the events it chronicles, and
it would seem to be “legend ‘vested in historical garments.”<a
href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> This would explain many of the
inconsistences in the <em>Primary Chronical</em>. The philosopher who
explains Eastern Christianity is really St. Cyril while wintering in
Crimea, and the others who speak to Vladimir are the other groups who
St. Cyril met with but who were not Christian.<a href="#fn26"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>
This changing of time would also explain why Vladimir’s men who went to
the west in search of religion encountered German Christians not Slavic
ones. By Vladimir’s time the Moravians had already been converted and
would have thus been the first Christians Vladimir’s men would have met
in the west.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Essentially, the chronicler,
possibly inadvertently, rearranged various stories and events so that
they would make the conversion of Vladimir more impactful.<a
href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> This chronicler failed however in
removing all references within the <em>Primary Chronical</em> to the
pre-Olga Christians, such as those discussed in the treaty of 945. Those
that are left, along with other small errors such as incorrect dates and
corresponding names, are the few hints that remain in <em>The Russian
Primary Chronical</em> that point towards a more complex and longer
spanning conversion than first appears to be the case.</p>
<p><em>The Russian Primary Chronicle</em>’s explanation of the
conversion of the Rus’ would appear to be largely a fabrication, mixing
and merging parts of various narratives while removing or modifying any
sections that might fail to properly show the highly divine nature of
Vladimir’s conversion. While failing to completely scrub away the
references to earlier Christians, the chronicle reinforces Vladimir’s
decision to the audience. The exaggerations in stories like that of St.
Olga are there to further show the intelligence in choosing Christianity
– a choice which was made by a ruler who was wise enough to review the
other options and make the correct choice, as the Chronicle makes
obvious to the audience.</p>
