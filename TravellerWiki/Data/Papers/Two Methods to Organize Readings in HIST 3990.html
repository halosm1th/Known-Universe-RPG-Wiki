<p>There are numerous ways one could organize the readings which have
been looked at in class so far. In this paper I will discuss two
possible methods of organization: an approach based on sovereignty and
modernity with a national focus; and an approach based on race, class,
and gender, as well as economics, with a transnational focus. This will
be done by describing the basic method of organization, an example of
how some of the readings may fit into that method of organization, and
finally the unique perspectives such a method brings forth.</p>
<p>The first method of organization would focus on the concepts of
sovereignty, and modernity on a national history level. In practice this
would mean exploring the course material by examining different claims
to sovereignty – where do they come from, how are they articulated, what
makes one claim valid and another invalid – and how those claims to
sovereignty are impacted by differing ideas of modernity, which is
directly related to how different nations conceptualize modernity
itself.</p>
<p>This scheme would focus on one individual nation at a time, asking
the question: “where does this nation’s sovereignty come from: from
within, as a nation defined by their members, or from the outside world,
through acknowledgements of nationhood and economic support from ‘great
powers’? As well, what does it mean to be a ‘modern’ nation: is it
modernity as understood by the popular classes, or modernity as
understood by national elites, if there is a difference between the two?
To accomplish this, readings would be grouped together on a national
basis, with each week examining a different nation within a similar
context. For example, examining each of the major nations discussed in
Larson’s <em>Trials of Nation Making</em> individually first, and then
comparing how the national identity and perceptions of modernity
developed by each of the nations as described by Larson were similar and
how they differed, and how they compared to claims of sovereignty and
ideas of modernity held by the people of the Andean heartland.</p>
<p>The advantages of this method are twofold: it highlights groups who
otherwise may have been ignored, and by exploring the ideas of modernity
and sovereignty of those groups, one might challenge existing
orthodoxies, exposing conflicts and inconsistencies in common
understandings of these terms and their history. For example, this view
would grant a greater emphasis to regional rulers in places like Mexico,
or the groups in the Andes beyond government reach, examining how these
groups viewed modernity and how their views contrast and relate to the
national view that these groups are supposed to be a part of, and asking
whether they were really a part of the larger nation who claimed them if
their views on subjects as fundamental to nationhood as sovereignty and
modernity differ so substantially.</p>
<p>An alternative method of organizing the course readings would be to
focus on race, class, and sex, and how they interact with and are
affected by national and local economics, especially with a
transnational focus. This scheme would deemphasize the nation itself,
and instead focus on people – what separates and unites them within a
nation and how does that relate to other similar nations, and what role
does the economy play in those changes. For example, this scheme might
choose to examine the differences between different societies that had
strong histories of trans-Atlantic slavery compared to those who relied
on indigenous exploitation for labor, and how that economic difference
impacts perceptions of race – and by extension gender and class – or how
the shared colonial class structure remained after revolutions but
evolved over time to suit the differing needs of the new nations. As
well, how do evolving concepts of race, class, and gender effect the
economies of various nations, such as Mexico embracing the idea of the
mestizo during a period of economic nationalism, helping to redefine
class, race, and gender lines as in the introduction of new racial
classifications through the othering of Chinese immigrants and the women
who were close to them. A core part of this would be to focus on the
transnational economic and social changes, such as Blumenthal’s
demonstration of the interconnectivity and influence among elites across
various nations, and how events like the Mexican nationalization of oil
led to American companies heading to Venezuela to extract oil, and the
effects that had on Venezuelan society.</p>
<p>The advantages of this view of history are that it focuses on the
majority of the population who may often be passed over in national
histories that focus on the select few whose individual acts shape
history, thereby making the general population players in creating
history instead of passively living through it. It would also help to
demonstrate how interconnected Latin America is, both internally and
with the greater world. By exploring the economic and not just social
implications of what has transpired in these nations’ histories, a more
complete picture can be drawn, as the social and economic milieus of
societies are intimately intertwined.</p>
<p>There are many ways to organize the course readings: this paper has
discussed two. The primary utility of both is giving a voice to groups
who normally would not have had such a voice but do so through different
approaches. The first approach offers extra focus be given to specific
disadvantaged groups and their claims to nationhood and the basis on
which they are made. The second focuses on the people themselves, caring
less about nationhood and more about why the people are where they are,
and how they live their lives because of it, and the role economics
played in getting there. These two approaches serve to highlight key
areas of difference and similarity in the course readings, which
provides students with a basis for understanding different approaches to
studying history.</p>
