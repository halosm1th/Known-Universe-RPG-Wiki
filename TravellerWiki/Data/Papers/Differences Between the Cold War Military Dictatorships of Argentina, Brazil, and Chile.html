<p>In South America, during the Cold War, several military
dictatorships, known as Juntas, took power to prevent the growth of
communism in South America. This paper will examine three such
dictatorships, those in Brazil, Argentina, and Chile in the years
ranging broadly from 1964 to 1990. By looking at the political
strategies and economic systems each regime used, this paper will
highlight what made each regime unique.</p>
<p>Overall, these three military dictatorships appear to have been more
similar than different. Each was a military regime that believed in the
rightness of its cause, justified the use of all means deemed necessary
to control the nation and population while they attempted to develop
their preferred path of economic development. The differences lie
largely in the details of their political institutions and approach to
economic development.</p>
<p>There are several key institutions which each of the military
governments created, such as the development of various intelligence
services which were used to wipe out both real and imagined political
and social opposition. For example, the US supported Operation Condor, a
shared kidnapping, assassination, and espionage ring which Brazil,
Argentina, Chile, and other countries were apart of. <a href="#fn1"

Each country had unique variants of similar institutions, such as
Brazil’s Electoral College, which allowed the country to maintain the
façade of democracy, and unlike Pinochet in Chile who ruled for 18 years
or Argentina’s 4 military presidents in 7 years, the Brazilian
Presidents also preferred to dress in suits over military dress uniform
as they wanted to present an image of protecting democracy.<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Where we see the most significant differences in the area of
political development is in the rational each military had for usurping
power. In Brazil, the military believed themselves to be a moderating
power, who had stepped in at various times of national distress to
correct the nations course, a tradition started with the 1889 coup over
Emperor Pedro II.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> In Argentina, the military junta
took power from Isabelita Peron, under the guise of a ‘Process of
National Reorganization’ to deal with the “epidemic of political
violence”, based on the logic that only the military was patriotic
enough to cleanse the nation of its problems, and based its legitimacy
on its outcomes, not its methods to reach those outcomes.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> In
Chile, the Junta came to power to stop the supposed spread of Marxism,
with the support of the United States due to the election of a socialist
president. To keep the socialist government out of power, the military
overthrew the government, and installed a junta to rule over it, with
each of the branches of the military, as well as the national police,
acting as a ruling council whose unanimous agreement was needed to
legislate, acting as check on its frontman’s, General Pinochet,
executive power.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> These reasons for taking power drove
different approaches to political institutions and demonstrate the
differences in these regimes: where Brazil had a façade of democracy, it
would ultimately have its electoral college voted in presidency work to
transition the country back to a real democracy. Argentina’s violent
rule was based on a failed claim to be improving society as demonstrated
by cheap nationalist tricks, but when those tricks finally failed –
after the junta’s defeat in the Falklands war – the legitimacy of the
government was quick to evaporate. For Chile, the government based its
legitimacy on being a bulwark against socialism through the
demonstration of the superiority of the free market, but when free
market shocks became too much to bear, it was ultimately the socialist
core – the copper company which the previous socialist government had
nationalised – which kept the country afloat during the free market
shocks.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Where we see more significant differences is in the area of economic
policy. None of the three can be described as socialist, but the degree
to which and the mechanisms whereby each nation embraced capitalism is
different. However, one trait shared by all three nations looked at in
this paper, is that they had placed varying degrees of their legitimacy
in economic reform, stabilization, and future prosperity. (It is because
of that shared overarching goal of tying regime legitimacy to economic
development that global market effects had such catastrophic impacts on
these nations – the 1973 and 1979 oil crashes and subsequent ripples
upset the government in each of these nations, despite their different
approaches to this common goal.) The most extreme of the free-market
capitalist outlook was Chile, while the least extreme was Brazil, with
Argentina taking a position somewhere in-between.</p>
<p>The military leaders of Brazil, unlike Chile, believed that the state
played an important role in the planning and development of industry,
and they wanted to use the free market to industrialize the country.<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> They were willing to follow the
IMF’s plan to stabilize the economy and gave the new military president
Coasta e Silva some space to advance his political aims. He used this
space to install Delfim Neto as finance minister, under whom “crawling
peg” indexing was begun in an attempt to stabilize the currency,
allowing the country to better engage in international trade and opening
credit to those interested in an attempt to increase demand and
stimulate production, while hiding the inflation caused by rapid
economic growth.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> As in Chile and Argentina, these
reforms helped to separate the upper and middle classes from the lower
classes as those who could participate in the system were rewarded,
while laborers who wanted to strike were prevented by harsh government
repression.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> This growth was hampered by the 1973
oil shock which quadrupled the cost for Brazil’s oil imports – from $710
million in 1973 to $2.8 billion in 1974. In response the government
increased state planning in an attempt to keep the economy growing,
taking more loans from foreign banks.<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
By 1975, the government had a 74.7% stake in the top 100 companies in
the country.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> The 1979 Iranian Revolution and oil
price boom led to another wave of inflation in Brazil, made more
complicated by three factors: Mexico’s defaulting on their foreign
debts, the country’s largest trading partner, the United States,
entering a recession, and its largest foreign creditor, also the United
States, increasing its interest rates.<a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
The junta was now having to pay half the value of the country’s exports
just to pay off the interest on its debts. The economic crisis had
demonstrated the military government’s inability to moderate the
nation’s distress, and it would soon fall to a civilian president.<a
href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The military junta in Argentina came to power following the economic
turbulence of the 1973 oil embargo; the 900% inflation made people want
a military coup.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> When the Junta took power, it had
two different goals which it gave to the government’s finance minister:
make the economy look like Chile, but without the unemployment.<a
href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> By crushing unions, and by offering
stability and the suppression of wages, the Junta grew the stock market
and flooded the economy with credit, starting a boom.<a href="#fn16"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>
The result of dropping barriers to trade led to layoffs from the largest
companies and the closing of smaller ones as people chose to buy
cheaper, better made imported goods. This forced the government to take
out foreign loans to support the remaining large companies, eventually
pushing the government to implement its own form of Crawling Peg
Indexing.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> When the second oil crash came, the
government took on business debt to keep the economy afloat, but by
March 1980 a string of bank collapses and runs demonstrated the failure
of the economy. When, a last ditch effort to keep popular support led to
launching the failed Falklands war, the Junta’s coffin closed.<a
href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Chile wanted to be the free market laboratory, an example of the
“Radical Free Market” – a country whose government depended on the
income from the antithetical beast it kept at its core – CODELCO, or the
National Copper Corporation.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> The Chilean economy
was managed by the “Chicago Boys”, a group of economists from the
Catholic University of Chile who were trained under Milton Friedman at
the University of Chicago in free market economics – advocating for
state divestiture from all aspects of the nation’s economy except
defense.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> When implemented in Chile, this led
to the mass privatization of not just state enterprises but also
services which are generally considered part of the state, such as
healthcare, education, and pensions.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Those with money were
able to buy the various once state-owned enterprises, and took control
of the state’s contracts, expanding their political and economic power,
with wealth from high interest loans.<a href="#fn22"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>
However, even during the second round of privatizations in the 1980s,
CODELCO was never privatized, even while the government was in a
liquidity crisis from the nationalization of the various collapsing
banks following the 1979 oil crash, against the advice of the Chicago
Boys, and which led to currency devaluations, a massive recession, and
30% unemployment.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> The destruction of trade barriers
had allowed the already weak internal markets to effectively collapse
from the volatility, making the country unable to weather the blow, and
would push Chile to go through six finance ministers from 1982-1985, and
replace the Chicago Boys with more moderate, business aligned
economists. At the same time, business leaders began to refocus their
political support from the military and Pinochet to the left and
opposition groups.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Each of the military regimes examined in this paper based their
legitimacy in large part on their ability to bring stability and ensure
economic growth, although in practice, each group employed increasingly
harsh and repressive means to beat out an enemy which may not even have
initially existed, but certainly did by the time the Junta’s fell. Each
regime justified their death squads, secrecy, detention, and torture
centers, fraudulent if any elections, and other horrors based on a
promise that economic prosperity could be strong armed into being
through the crushing of one’s enemies, and when outside factors
prevented that prosperity the house of cards on which each regime rested
ultimately came crashing down.</p>
