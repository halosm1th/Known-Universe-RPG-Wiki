<p>Christianity was winning the battle for control over the Roman Empire
by the end of the fourth century. However, it was struggling to take
religious control over the province of North Africa, whose wide range of
religious diversity helped to play a vital role in Christianity’s, and
Roman Catholicism’s, process of defining itself: defining itself as
separate from the Jewish religion from which it came, from the other
Christian sects in North Africa and elsewhere who challenged the
authority of the Empire-aligned Catholic Church, and from the pagans who
had been the foundation of the Empire for most of its life. To see how
Christianity was able to define itself in this way, this paper will
examine the relationship between the Jewish and Christian people in
North Africa and the Jewish heritage visible in places in Ethiopia far
into the future; the role Donatists played in helping to define the
Catholic church as separate from their own, while also playing a role in
merging the Catholic Church and Roman States; and finally examining the
Catholic view of pagan religions and how the Universal Church encouraged
pagans to embrace and take pride in their local culture instead of the
dominant Roman culture of the Empire.</p>
<p>What denotes the difference between a Christian and a Jew in North
Africa? Examining artifacts in the modern day can make it difficult to
differentiate,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and it is not made any easier by
places like Ethiopia, whose Christian faith had a strong Judaic twist to
it.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Artifacts can be especially
difficult to place, as both Christians and Jewish groups shared many
stories, such as the sacrifice of Isaac, but were often associated with
Christianity, which can embellish the perception of popular belief.<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> This is made more challenging when
considering that a person in North Africa may have had many ‘identities’
which made up the person: “one woman might identify herself as a Jew
while entering a synagogue, as a Roman of the provinces when
participating in Roman law courts, and as a Punic-speaker in the
marketplace.”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> As well, such a person with a
multitude of identities may even have embraced more than one concept of
divinity.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> These challenges are compounded by
the lack of standardized thought even among religions, such as Judaism,
as the culture of Jews in North Africa was different than that of those
in Asia Minor or Rome.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> When all this is combined with the
specter of time, the end result is a mess of identity and religion that
lacked a clear boundary between Roman, Jewish, North African, and even
Christian to an extent. This Christian-Jewish mix could be seen
prominently in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>While in other parts of the Empire the Jewish-Christian schism may
have been clear due to its own self-imposition,<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
this was not the case in Ethiopia, where instead Christians maintained a
strong Jewish heritage far into the future. An obvious example of this
would be the Ethiopian practice of recognizing the Sabbath<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>,
and its eventually attempted forced conversion to Catholicism in the
17<sup>th</sup> century.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Throughout North Africa,
Christianity found a stronger “regional influence than Graeco-Roman
influence”<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> and was less effected by the schism
and its future Hellenistic beliefs, instead developing to care more
about its own traditions.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> This shared focus on
traditions and ideas helped to create what St. Augustine would call a
“Unity” separate from the Catholic Church, instead composed of
“Heretics, Jews, and pagans”<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> which seemed to
encompass much of Roman North African. But what about the Christian
heretics who St. Augustine is speaking of?</p>
<p>After the last of Diocletian’s Great Persecutions several new
Christian sects arose, and by 451 the Copts of Egypt had had enough and
rejected the Orthodoxy which had been imposed on them,<a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>
as they feared the role religion was taking on in society.<a
href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> The Coptics, like the Donatists,
rejected the claim that the Emperors’ authority could unite the
Church,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> which in practice had become true
as North Africa had begun to drift away from the Empire into its own
sphere.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> This stood in opposition to the
Catholics who saw it as their Emperor-sanctioned duty to create a
Universal church.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Neither side was truly in a
commanding position though, as seen during the Conference of 411, where
it was reported that there were 284 Donatist bishops and 286 Catholic
bishops,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> which shows just how little control
the Catholics actively had over the area. Towns were happy to switch
between faiths, especially from Donatist to Catholic, so long as they
were given a local bishop instead of a priest;<a href="#fn19"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
this was difficult for the Catholic Church which struggled to recruit
clergy members and was thus often scraping the bottom of the proverbial
barrel.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> When “bishop bribing” failed, the
Empire employed forms of repression such as banning from employment.<a
href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> While initially not forced to
convert, this would change in 405 when the Donatists were denied their
church, leading to some false conversions;<a href="#fn22"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>
for some Catholics however it was seen as a rightful continuation of
Roman Citizenship – to be a full Roman Citizen, one must practice the
correct religion<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> - while some, like St. Augustine,
may have believed this practice was fair, on the ground the Emperors’
lack of control often meant that enforcement fell to the locals, and how
fair that was is not as clear.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>One of the key areas of difference between Donatists and Catholics is
the importance placed on scripture, especially the literal scripts and
books from which the holy stories came. For the Donatists, the
internalization of scripture was a grand assertion of belief.<a
href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> This is because a common belief in
the Antiquity period was that letters, books, etc. often contained the
‘spirit’ of the author,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> and that destroying Holy Books, as
had been ordered previously, was tantamount to destroying God.<a
href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Of course, Catholics like St.
Augustine did not deny the value of scripture, even seeing the healing
powers of the object as superior to that of an amulet,<a href="#fn28"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
they simply favoured religious unity, hoping to restore the Empire while
continuing the work of previous Emperors.<a href="#fn29"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>
However, due to the Emperors’ lack of control over North Africa, and the
high degree of religious diversity, the bishops were given a large
degree of power and leeway to ensure that the law was enforced and unity
brought about.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>But this idea of unity within the Roman Empire from the Emperor was
offensive to some, especially those who would have once been the
dominant religious group in the Empire: pagans. The pagan Maximus, for
example argued with St. Augustine over the value of the ”civic cults of
his <em>colonia.</em>”<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> For this pagan at least, there was
not a denial of the Christian God as <em>a</em> god, even the highest
god;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> instead Maximus’ argument rests on
the claim that multiple different deities could offer a route to the
highest god.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> As well, for Maximus the forum was
home to the old, Roman, gods; to become Christian meant abandoning them
and the whole of Roman divinity and culture, something Maximus was
against.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> For Augustine there was a different
outcome which the pagan could embrace. Maximus could leave behind the
old Roman gods and instead embrace his own, African, culture and
literature.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> For most pagans, tradition was
extremely important, and a movement swept over the Empire of educated
Romans debating the value of traditional religion against the new
encroaching religion, couching their discussions in literary works and
great thinkers of the past like St. Augustine and Maximus had done in
their discussion.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>North Africa, on the opposite side of the Mediterranean from what had
once been the heart of the Roman Empire, was now becoming harder and
harder for Emperors to maintain their control over. This was only made
more difficult by the religious differences present in the region, but
it had many effects on Christianity: it challenged the belief that
Christianity was separate from Judaism, as seen in Ethiopia and the
makeup of the people on the ground; it was challenged by the Donatists
and Coptics, whose unwillingness to bend to the Emperor combined with
popular support forced the Church to assume a more controlling role in
the region; meanwhile the educated debated religion using traditional
language and concepts, forcing those who would debate them back to be
educated in the Old World, thus preserving some amount of those
traditions.</p>
