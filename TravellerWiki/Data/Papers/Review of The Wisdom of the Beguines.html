<p>Laura Swan’s “The Wisdom of the Beguines: The Forgotten Story of a
Medieval Women’s movement” is an insightful dive into an area of
medieval history that seems to have been forgotten about until recently.
As the title says, Swan discusses the informal medieval women’s movement
known as the beguines, explaining who they were, how they lived, and
their beliefs about God, the Catholic Church, and how their devotion to
those beliefs allowed them to live a life of independence granted to few
other women in that period.</p>
<p>This review will surmise the core theme of the book, before
discussing its use of sources, the writing style employed in the book,
how those came together to construct the book’s central argument, and
the areas of the book where I would have liked to see more information
or discussion.</p>
<p>The core theme of “The Wisdom of the Beguines” is in its title: it is
a discussion and summarization of current literature on the beguines.
Beguines are introduced to the reader as a group of “laywomen, not nuns,
and thus [they] did not take solemn vows and did not live in
monasteries.”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The women went by different names
depending on where in Europe they were, but they shared a “common way of
life, chastity and simplicity, their unusual business acumen, and their
commitment to God and to the poor and marginalized.”<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In
the subsequent chapters, Swan explains who the beguines were and how
they existed across Europe, what life in a beguinage would have been
like, the various aspects of their spiritual beliefs, both personal and
their ministry of it, ending with a brief discussion of beguine writers,
and if the beguines were heretics. All of these coalesce around the core
theme of summarizing current information on this medieval women’s
movement.</p>
<p>In order to summarize the current academic understanding of the
beguines, one must have a solid foundation of information to build on.
For Swan, the foundation is vast, as evident in the bibliography which
spans thirteen pages. The sources in the bibliography were mostly
written in the last thirty years; while this is most likely due to
relatively recent interest taken in this area of study, it does raise a
question of diversity of viewpoints within the area of research.
However, that question is less concerning given the range of authors and
sources listed in the bibliography; works from numerous different
authors predominantly from North America and Europe fill its pages, with
some authors having multiple works listed, but none listed so often so
as to appear dominant in a single trend of research.</p>
<p>The bibliography is well sourced with a variety of authors, but what
about the actual in-chapter citations? If the author were a student,
this essay would have problems due to its lack of citations and over
reliance on a single source for early chapters. The first four chapters
citations have a heavy reliance on Walter Simons <em>Cities of
Ladies</em>, and while later chapters improve on this, all the chapters
struggle with citing their sources in detail – most chapters having
around twenty footnotes – which in turn makes it hard to verify where
any single claim made in the book comes from, instead trusting that it’s
vaguely in the cited source, or that one of the books in the
bibliography discusses it. Overall, the sources used seem great, but
they could have been used more in the chapters themselves.</p>
<p><em>The Wisdom</em> <em>of the Beguines</em> is well written, the
introduction does a good job of grabbing the reader, establishing what
the book will be about, while also informing the reader of the author’s
own personal interest and connection to the subject. The writing
throughout is engaging, starting chapters with a short narrative or dive
into the theme of the chapter, before expanding into a broad outline of
what will be covered in the chapter, and then giving its actual
argument. Each section has a solid through argument adding to the core
thesis of the chapter. When an argument is presented, it is often
followed up by a short rephrasing of the argument or idea to ensure the
reader truly understands the idea that is being put forward, such as
when discussing the beguine’s view of the eucharist: “Many beguines were
content with gazing upon the elevated host and not concerned with
receiving it. Their passion was to see and gaze upon the consecrated
host – not to partake.”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The use of repetition does not only occur in explanations. Throughout
the various chapters, examples of different beguines fill the page. The
examples are interesting, written in a style that first gives the reader
a taste of what the example is about, followed by the background for the
example – the history of the person, who are they, what kind of family
they came from, how they came to live the beguine way of life – and then
the author returns to the topic at hand, expanding on the example to
give the relevant information. However, over time these examples begin
to blur together, which causes truly exceptional examples to begin to
appear more mundane, such as the examples for the Spanish beata’s in the
discussion of their possible status as heretics.</p>
<p>The writing truly shines at the start of chapters three and five, in
which Swan offers a first person ‘time traveller’ point of view. These
short chapter introductions help to truly ground the beguines as people
in the world, pulling the reader into a vivid literary rendering of the
world that they had until then been reading about from a bird’s eye
view. The narrative also helps to reinforce the ideas presented in and
before their given chapters. Descriptions such as “There are women with
hooded capes accompanying frail women, and some are bustling about with
baskets of food. Children are chasing a ball. A steep-roofed stone
church stands proudly toward your left.”<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
help to cement the idyllic nature of beguines in their place in history,
with their little slice of heaven on earth, showing how the beguines
care for the young and old, are pious, and have safety in where they are
and what they are doing.</p>
<p>The strong first person and academic writing are further helped by
the author’s choice to draw parallels to later religious movements, such
as the Quakers or shakers as each group was “under what they felt was
the powerful sway of the Holy Spirit, [and] were willing to give
expression outwardly to what they experienced inwardly.”<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>
This allows the reader to see that while the beguines are interesting
and unique in some ways, their religious devotion is not one of those
unique ways.</p>
<p>As the book goes on, the dependency on previous chapters and work
begins to fade, making it easier to take a chapter out of context and
read it on its own, such as the chapter on literary beguines, but all
chapters depend on themes and ideas initially established in chapters
one through three. This lack of dependency is most obvious in the use of
examples, as each chapter has many example beguines for its specific
argument, but, as noted earlier, the overall volume of them causes many
of the examples to blur together. For example, there are several key
beguines who are especially discussed in chapter eight, but who are
referenced throughout the book; however their late explanation makes it
harder to have tracked them throughout the book.</p>
<p>This could have been presented differently, if the author had chosen
instead to make a few ‘main characters’ in chapter one – one or two main
beguines from each of the major regions discussed in chapter 2 – and
then used those women as a foundation to frame each of the chapters
around. Presented in that fashion, I think the book would have had a
stronger narrative throughout, instead of being a series of
semi-inter-dependent chapters discussing the beguines. These chapters
could then highlight a single core person who personifies this goal and,
compare them against the other ‘core people’ who have been determined
from previous chapters. Then, in the context of those people across
various regions, outlines and interesting cases could also be appended
to act as examples of various other cases, instead of always reaffirming
the strongest similarities, as occurs more often in the later
chapters.</p>
<p>The second area of criticism I have is with the author’s lack of
skepticism. Swan is careful to mention that the <em>vitae</em>
referenced throughout as the basis for many of the beguines are
“composed with ‘attitude,’ meaning the writer … shaped the story in
order to highlight and promote sanctity, to emphasize moral story or
argument, and to convert people to a better life.”<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>
However, I believe not enough skepticism was applied to these vitae.
This is seen in the quick way that beguine detractors are dismissed. For
example, the French poet Rutebeuf who satirized the beguines offers a
small bit of fair criticism, that everything the beguines do is
interpreted as pious, divine and Holy.<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
Those who opposed the beguines are generally surmised as feeling
threatened, either by the beguine piety or in “their ability to produce
cloth at lower prices than guild artisans.”<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> The
author also ignores contradictions in the beguine world view, such as
the general belief of casting out those who got pregnant unexpectedly,
while the beguines also helped poor prostitutes because they understood
the dangers of being a women in the medieval world.<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
While this can be attributed to a failure to follow the internal rule vs
external forces, and the differences between different beguine groups, I
believe it is fair to question this contradiction in thought from those
who are otherwise portrayed a righteous and devout, as that view denies
the beguines their own agency to be bad people – if they could take
issue with corruption of those superior to them in the institutional
Church, it seems only fair that a self examination is done as well – and
due to the size, scale, and diversity of beguines and beguinages that
there would be some examples of beguines who were false in their
beliefs, and a chapter examining them I believe would have been helpful
and interesting.</p>
<p><em>The Wisdom of the Beguines</em> by Laura Swan is an interesting
study into a fascinating and important women’s movement whose devotion
and faith were essential to their ability to do something magnificent –
be truly independent in a male dominated world. Swan has a deep sense of
respect and care for the beguines and her writing leaves the reader with
a hunger to know more about this movement.</p>
