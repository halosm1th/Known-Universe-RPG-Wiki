<p>The Crusades were a sanguinary enterprise, and the motivations of
those who went to fight were many. Some joined out of devotion to the
Church, others out of a desire for wealth, or for any number of other
reasons which depended upon who that person was, where they were born,
what had occurred during their life, etc. For those in Venice when word
reached of the calling of a Fourth Crusade, their responses were varied.
In the time since then, because of the horrors brought by the Fourth
Crusade, their reasons for crusading have come under scrutiny. From one
point of view, the Venetians were capitalists seeking to make a profit
on devout crusaders, whose devotion was exploited by the Venetians to
settled old scores and expand their Empire through the destruction of
their rival Zara and the conquest of Constantinople.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
From another point of view the Venetians were a group of devout
crusaders who, through a series of unfortunate events and choices,
destroyed the Christian city of Zara, then sacked and conquered the
Christian city of Constantinople, heart of the Byzantine Empire, and
home to the Greek Church, with whom the Latin Church hoped one day to
reunify.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The truth lies somewhere between
these two points of view. This paper will examine the way in which the
costs of preparing for the Crusade combined with a series of unfortunate
events which occurred as the crusade was underway, led to the capture
and sacking of Constantinople. This will be accomplished by providing an
overview of the Fourth Crusade, then examining the differing motivations
between the Venetian leaders of the Crusade and their foot soldiers,
followed by an examination of the economic motivations of the Crusaders
once underway, and how those motivations led to the sacking of
Constantinople.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>In 1198, with the ascension of Pope Innocent III a new crusade to
retake the Holy Land was proclaimed. The plan was to sneak through Egypt
because the Crusaders had realized that so long as the Muslims could
raise an army from Egypt, they could retake Jerusalem.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> To
fund this enterprise, the Pope called for a direct tax on the Church.
This can be seen in the Pope’s writing to the Archbishop and clergy of
Magdeburg that they needed “to render at least a fortieth part of all
his ecclesiastical revenues in money and in kind for the aid of the Holy
Land.”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> This was especially impactful on the
Venetians, to whom Pope Innocent also wrote, calling for an end to the
Venetians’ trade with Egypt, and to instead turn their resources to
helping the Holy Land, and to keep suffering through the losses in trade
revenue.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The Doge of Venice negotiated with the representatives of the
Crusaders, agreeing to transport 4,500 horses and knights, 9,000
esquires, and 20,000 foot soldiers, for a fee of 85,000 marks.<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> To transport the knights and horses,
special ships had to be built, and to ensure there would be enough
ships, trade with other ports was suspended for the summer as they
waited for Crusaders to arrive, with the hope of leaving by the end of
June.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> They would not set out until the
start of October. Further complicating the matter, only 1,000 Knights
and 50,000- or 60,000-foot soldiers arrived, well below what had been
speculated, and from them only 50,000 of the agreed upon 85,000 marks
could be gathered.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> To pay off the debt, the Doge of
Venice proposed that the Venetians be paid off with money gathered from
the first conquest en-route. However, because it was winter, they could
not cross the sea to Egypt.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Instead the Doge
proposed they attack the city of Zara, because they “have done us much
evil, and I and my men want to punish them, if we can … [and because]
The city of Zara is very rich and well supplied with all kinds of
provisions.”<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> This would settle an old score,
while ensuring that the army was fed and prepared for the proper Crusade
come spring.</p>
<p>While laying siege to Zara, the townsfolk offered to surrender the
city, but were convinced by some in the Crusaders’ army to give up on
their plea for peace as the crusading pilgrims would not support the
Venetians in their attack against a Christian city. This angered the
Doge, who had been speaking to a council of barons and counts on what to
do with the offer. One member of the clergy spoke against the Doge,
saying “I forbid you, in the name of the pope at Rome, to attack this
city; for the inhabitants are Christians and you are pilgrims.”<a
href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> The Doge pointed out that he nearly
had the city until those in the army spoke against him, and now the
pilgrims should do as they promised and aid the Doge in conquering the
city, which they did in 5 days.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> After the city had
been taken, the two armies settled in for the winter.</p>
<p>As summer came around, the pilgrims realized they lacked the
necessary money or supplies to continue their crusade. The Doge told the
crusaders that “Greece is a very rich land and bountifully supplied with
everything [we need].”<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> This was supported by the Frankish
leader of the Crusade, Boniface of Montferrat, who told of meeting the
‘rightful’ heir to the Byzantine Empire, and that by installing the heir
on the throne, the Crusaders could get the supplies and money they
needed from the new Byzantine Emperor.<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The crusaders then went on and conquered Constantinople, installing
Alexius III on the throne. Once on the throne, he paid the crusaders and
Venetians their promised money, but failed to deliver the agreed upon
supplies.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> The bishops agreed this war was a
righteous one: “for the Greeks were traitors and murderers, and also
disloyal, since they had murdered their rightful lord, and were worse
than Jews.”<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> After a failed attack, a second was
launched and succeeded. With the success of the siege, the crusaders
sacked and pillaged the city, raping, slaughtering, and looting.<a
href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Holy artifacts were looted from
churches, sometimes by crusaders and sometimes by churchmen seeking to
protect the artifacts, altars were destroyed, and blood was spilled.<a
href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>As a result of the violence against their fellow Christians, any hope
of reunifying the Greek and Latin churches was shattered. This was one
of the largest of the many reasons behind the anger of the Pope, another
being the absolution of crusading vows for those who were going to stay
in the new Latin Empire which the Pope said was outside the authority of
those priests who were with the crusaders to absolve.<a href="#fn19"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>In the narrative of the Fourth Crusade, the Doge of Venice, and
Boniface of Montferrat played key roles in influencing the fate of the
Crusade and its destinations. This highlights one of the key issues
during this crusade: the difference in information between the leaders
and the soldiers.</p>
<p>A clear example of the withholding of information can be seen in the
different reasons for the groups going on Crusade, specifically the
Franks and the Venetians. The Venetians believed the Crusade on
Constantinople had been sanctioned by the Pope, with the hope of putting
Alexius III on the throne to reunite the Greek and Latin Churches, while
the Franks believed they were making a stop along the way to their
actual destination of Egypt.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> In reality, Montferrat
wanted to settle an old score, and put Alexis III on the throne, while
the Doge wanted to get paid for the resources Venice had devoted to the
Crusade.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>It is important to remember that the Venetians were not just
interested in money. The foot soldiers were devout crusaders themselves
and hoped to be good servants of the pope, hence why they were quick to
take such dramatic actions as halting trade for months on end and
devoting considerable manpower and resources to the Crusade.<a
href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> As well, due to the secrecy
enforced by the Doge, the Venetians were not aware of their
excommunication and the Pope’s lack of support for attacking
Constantinople.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> They, like their Frankish
counterparts, were wary about attacking Constantinople, but due to
language barriers and intentional separation of forces, the two factions
could not interact and share their misgivings of the upcoming attack.<a
href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, while the average Venetian may have been motivated by money to
some degree, they joined the Crusade out of devotion to the Church and
its pope.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> The Venetians’ excommunication had
been held from them out of fear that the Venetians might leave the
Crusade, as they had no deep desire to destroy Constantinople, which the
Venetians had done a great deal of trade with, and may have instead
preferred a new trade partner in a possible Crusader-controlled Egypt.<a
href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Crusading is expensive, and it because of this fact that the Pope
issued a direct tax on the Church to pay for the Fourth Crusade. In
preparing for the Crusade, trade from Venice was halted, special ships
to transport the horses had to be commissioned, resources were used, and
men were required, all of which needed to be paid for.<a href="#fn27"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>
An amount had been agreed to, 85,000 marks, which according to Queller
and Day was in line with costs to transport personnel during previous
crusades.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> As a result of chance, the group of
Crusaders who arrived in Venice was smaller than expected, and were only
able to gather 50,000 marks of their fare, even after charging the
Crusaders above the agreed upon rates and having used all possible lines
of credit.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> The Venetians deserved to be paid
for their resources and lost trade, and the Crusaders were responsible
for missing the pre-agreed launch deadline. With winter set in, travel
by ocean was limited, narrowing the options for the Crusaders until the
choice of Zara appeared – the small fact that it was under papal
protection could be ignored and justified – so it was attacked.<a
href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> After spending winter in the city,
exhausting its resources, the Crusaders needed to gather more, as well
as the outstanding debts owed to Venice. This economic reason, combined
with a political motive from Montferrat – a personal issue with
Constantinople - and a religious motive – the reunification of the two
dominant Christian Churches – made for an appealing target for the
Crusade’s leadership.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> The practical economic motivation
is further reinforced after the installation of Alexius III as Emperor,
who paid his monetary debt, but owed the Crusaders the truly important
logistical element of provisions and resources. It is the failure to
provide these provisions which motivated the Doge to once again attack
Constantinople and allowing for it to be given to various Crusaders as
their fiefs, to form the new Latin Empire.<a href="#fn32"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>
In the aftermath of the sack of Constantinople, the Venetians had been
repaid and resupplied, the Franks got lands, and the Church got holy
artifacts and the establishment of a Latin empire out of
Constantinople.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>War depends on men and materiel, and in the Fourth Crusade, the
Crusaders had a lot of bodies, but a poor logistical network. The
failure of people to arrive in Venice, combined with both parties’ need
to uphold their contracts to one another, led to a series of events
which resulted in the sacking of Constantinople and the foundation of
the Latin Empire. While the Venetians surely profited from the Crusade,
many of their soldiers were devout Catholics who went on Crusade to
fight for their faith. The Doge of Venice seems to have been more
motivated by money, yet this desire is at least in part motivated by
wanting to ensure his people were repaid for their goods and services.
However, it is because of the Doge’s desire to settle an old score with
Zara, and his lying to his troops, that the Crusade was able to spiral
so out of control, and it was because of economic motivations – the
desire to be repaid and to have enough supplies for the Crusades – that
the spiraling went as far as it did.</p>
