<p>“In the present social and cultural context, where there is a
widespread tendency to relativize truth, practising charity in truth
helps people to understand that adhering to the values of Christianity
is not merely useful but essential for building a good society and for
true integral human development.”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Published in 2009, this
quote from the papal encyclical <em>Caritas In Veritate</em> has only
become more relevant as society slips further into a deeply and
increasingly polarized post-truth and fake news world. In the
encyclical, Pope Benedict XVI discussed a number of issues pressing both
when the encyclical was written, and still so in the post COVID-19
pandemic world. This paper will reflect on some of the key issues
addressed by Pope Benedict XVI, such as wealth inequality,
globalization, and the development of people. It will begin with a short
overview of the encyclical, followed by further analysis of each point
individually, and finally summarizing the core points, connecting them,
and demonstrating the value of these ideas to world leaders, young
people, Catholics, Marxists, and many others in world.</p>
<p><em>Caritas in Veritate</em> was initially written to commemorate the
40<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Encyclical <em>Populorum
Progressio</em>, written by Pope Paul VI, however, the 2008 financial
crisis caused the encyclical to be delayed.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The
encyclical followed on <em>Populorum Progressio</em>’s theme of
examining the Church’s social teachings, reflecting on where
<em>Populorum Progressio</em> is still applicable and the places where
the social teaching needed to be expanded on. Some of the key areas
explored in the encyclical are wealth inequality, global hunger, the
relationship between rights and duties, and the development of a person,
connected through the concept of Charity in Truth.</p>
<p>The encyclical begins with a discussion on the topic of Charity in
Truth, explaining how charity is at the heart of the Church’s social
doctrine, and that modern societies have abandoned charity as irrelevant
in interpreting and directing moral responsibility. It goes on to argue
that “Truth is the light that gives meaning and value to charity.”<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> This is because truth is what keeps
charity from becoming sentimentality and “love becomes an empty shell,
to be filled in an arbitrary way.”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>After the discussion of truth, the first chapter returns to
discussing the message of <em>Populorum Progressio</em>, and how in an
increasingly globalized world, “reason, by itself, is capable of
grasping the equality between men and of giving stability to their civil
coexistence, but it cannot establish fraternity.”<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> It
is for this reason that humanity needs the Church’s social teachings, so
that a global fraternity may be established in the increasingly global
world. Continuing the theme of globalization, the second chapter brings
together globalization and human development, discussing the dangers of
one pursuing wealth for the sake of gaining wealth, and how these themes
combined work to reinforce inequality in the world. The third chapter
relates the growth of wealth inequality to the lack of fraternity in the
modern world, continuing on the theme of focusing on profits by advising
that people push for a system which focuses not only on profits, but
also on how one’s actions effect the community around them. Chapter 4
discusses the relationship between rights and responsibilities,
including the responsibility to help one another, and a responsibility
to the environment. The latter, the Pope reminds the reader, must be
cared for by man, but the resources and environment ultimately exist to
better mankind’s collective quality of life. Because of this, rich
countries should be investing in renewable and more green technology so
as to benefit the poorer countries, and as well, that rich countries
should be working to ensure that poor countries have greater control
over their resources. In chapter 5, the Pope discusses the relationship
between isolation and poverty, explaining that isolation drives poverty,
among other social issues, and the Pope advocates for more local
charities and groups to help those in need instead of massive
multinationals which take money from everywhere but produce few
beneficial results for local communities, as well as advocating for a
stronger United Nations that also gives a greater voice to smaller
nations so as to ensure their ability to be heard. The sixth chapter
discusses the role of technology in the globalized world, and it
highlights two fears: the first that decisions will be made not on
ethical grounds but on technical grounds, and second that as people get
distilled into technical psychological beings without a soul, they begin
to feel lost and empty. This paper will be focused on exploring the
encyclical’s themes of wealth inequality, globalization, and the
development of people.</p>
<p>Wealth inequality is a major issue in the world today, according to
the World Inequality Report: “The poorest half of the global population
barely owns any wealth at all, possessing just 2% of the total. In
contrast, the richest 10% of the global population own 76% of all
wealth.”<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The issue of wealth inequality is
something made worse with the COVID pandemic, as the pandemic led to
increased unemployment which in turn brought an increase in wealth
inequality, which is compounded by inflation, an issue that is affecting
the entire world as a result of supply chain issues.<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> In
light of these trends, the Pope’s reminder that the market “must be
structured and governed in an ethical manner”<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>
becomes much more pressing to world leaders and young people – if we
want to deal with issues like wealth inequality and improve our quality
of life, we must restructure our markets to be more ethical. An example
of this is Canadian garbage, which was sent to the Philippines. This act
demonstrates the global nature of the world and, the lack of fraternity
within it, as Canadians in a rich country shipped their garbage to a
poor country rather than deal with it themselves, an unethical but
potentially profitable action.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The Pope noted that globalization could be a force for good, using
global markets to help lift poor countries out of poverty. This can be
seen in the reduction in global hunger and malnourishment, something
which had been a great concern of Pope Benedict XVI. When <em>Caritas In
Veritate</em> was written, there were approximately 684.4 million
undernourished people; by 2019 that had dropped to 650 million, with its
lowest point being 2014 with only 609.9 million undernourished people.<a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> However, as the Pope noted, there
is rising undernourishment even among rich countries, -a trend made
worse with the COVID pandemic, and which will likely continue to
increase as climate change damages the environment, and wealth
inequality grows.</p>
<p>Considering the growing wealth inequality, the encyclical reminds the
reader of the relationship between rights and duties. On this topic, the
Pope says: “Many people today would claim that they owe nothing to
anyone except themselves. They are concerned only with their rights, and
they often have great difficulty in taking responsibility for their own
and other people’s integral development.”<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
This is a situation which COVID has exacerbated, as the truckers protest
in Canada demonstrates. Much of the rhetoric during the event was
focused on one’s rights and freedoms, yet there was little discussion of
one's obligations, demonstrating perfectly what Pope Benedict XVI
highlighted. Pope Benedict XVI recommends that governments transition
from focusing only on economic issues to also focusing on ethical
issues; in Canada this can be seen with the rise in young people pushing
for an ethical governmental relationship with First Nations people built
on the ethics-based idea of reconciliation. The Pope warned of the
government not acting morally but rather following the advice of
technocrats acting without ethical consideration, a Canadian example of
which is the Quebec government toying with the idea of taxing the
unvaccinated.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Although one may have a social
obligation to get vaccinated, that does not make it ethical for the
government to coerce the unwilling into getting vaccinated, even if from
a purely technical perspective, it is better that more people are
vaccinated.</p>
<p>According to the Pope, another aspect of the purely technical
perspective is “the tendency to consider the problems and emotions of
the interior life from a purely psychological point of view.”<a
href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> This view, combined with a lack of
fraternity as discussed by the Pope, may be part of what is driving the
division in modern society – people turn their opposition into a set of
psychological groupings, and those with whom they disagree are made
incapable of developing due to those same groupings, as our ethical
drive is “often overwhelmed or supressed by ethical and cultural
considerations of individualistic and utilitarian nature.”<a
href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> With our suppressed ethical drives,
in the increasingly globalized but isolated world, “the soul feels
abandoned,”<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> while the person grows depressed
from the lack of fraternity; they channel their emotions into anger,
placing blame for their isolation on others, worsening their mental
health. This is another area COVID has made worse, as increased
isolation from lockdowns, combined with the increasing inflation, drives
the prices of mental health treatment higher, highlighting another form
of inequality between those who can get mental health treatments and
those left to suffer on their own.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>As we recover from the COVID pandemic, it is worthwhile for world
leaders, youth, government employees, Catholics, and others in society
to reflect on Charity in Truth. The rising inflation will only increase
the inequality in wealth, the changing environment will make global
undernourishment a greater challenge, and as a result, people will
become more tribal and utilitarian. It is for these reasons that popes’
writings are valuable to world leaders, young people demanding change,
and anyone else worried about the future of humanity. The concept of
fraternity, and its role in the development of mentally and physically
healthy people and the communities that nurture them is worthy of deeper
consideration. As well, the restructuring of free markets to take into
consideration ethical matters, and then using that ethical market to
reduce wealth inequality between rich and poor countries, and between
the rich and poor within those countries, is something world leaders and
the young should be considering as they transition to a post-COVID
world.</p>
