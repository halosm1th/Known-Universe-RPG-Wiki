<p>Three of the most important contributions of the medieval world to
the modern world are: the development of representative government, the
merging of Christian ethics with Roman law, and the development of the
credit economy. This is because these three contributions are at the
heart of the modern globalized world, as they were each instrumental in
laying the foundation for that modern, globalized world.</p>
<p>Representative government arose as a source of negotiation between
the King and his nobles, including representatives of the Church. It
arose in the period after the fall of the Roman Empire, from warlords
conquering lands, then parcelling out the newly captured lands to their
loyal soldiers, developing the early feudal system. As the leaders of
the warriors who captured these lands died off, the loyalty felt by
those who held the lands began to wane; the nobles wanted to ensure that
their children and grandchildren would inherit the land that they had
fought for. This helped in the development of property rights. As a
secondary effect, due to the late Roman Empire’s system of requiring
people to work the same job as their parent, serfdom developed, giving
the nobles a group of people who were able to supply the nobles with
resources.</p>
<p>To protect their property rights, the nobles adapted the concept of
precedent, and through precedent developed their court. At the same
time, Kings needed money and manpower to continue to conquer and expand
their lands; using these openings nobles began to use their power to
negotiate more favourable taxation rates along with protections for
their various noble privileges.</p>
<p>Over time, as the relationship between the nobles and king tightened,
representation was given to the gentry in the form of the House of
Commons in England and the Estates General in France, both offering some
way for those closer to the common folk to have a say. As parliament
developed, through the negotiations of paying taxes to the king, it grew
more powerful and independent, and by 1688 in Britain the Glorious
Revolution would grant parliament supremacy over the Island, setting the
foundation for the modern Westminster system with parliamentary
supremacy.</p>
<p>The mixture of Roman law and Christian ethics similarly developed
over the Middle Ages. As Germanic tribes took lands the Romans once
controlled, they brought with them their legal system based on crimes
against families and grudges. However, as the Germans integrated into
the old Roman cities, they slowly took on more Romanesque legal codes,
creating a written legal system, combined with the Germanic ideas of
precedent, which worked to protect nobles’ property rights, which were
expressed as part of the Roman concept of Natural Rights.</p>
<p>The Roman concept of Natural Rights was worked over by Christian
scholars, who merged the works of Aristotle and Plato with their
Christian ethics and understanding, reinterpreting them to create the
foundation of western morality. This foundation is the basis of modern
natural, universal human rights. These rights are essential in the
modern drive for equality and equity, offering a platform on which
social justice can be aspired to.</p>
<p>The third major contribution from the Middle Ages is the modern
economic system. This was motivated by the Christian ethic and the
nobles’ development of property rights. This is because in the Roman
Empire, there was no significant incentive for those in positions of
power to value and use money to create more wealth and money. This can
be seen in the philosophical works of Aristotle which opposed the idea
of credit, as money could not create new money – an idea which the
Catholic Church would oppose as well and which the church titled
‘usury’. At the same time, nobles were developing a strong foundation
for property rights.</p>
<p>As the medieval world developed, following the reintroduction of
trade with the Middle East and the reintroduction of classical ideas
from the Crusades, the traders of Europe needed a way to conduct
international trade. To solve this problem, money lenders and banking
families began to develop. These families would make a small profit
based off of the trade of money between countries, exploiting the
difference in precious metal quantities of various regions’ coinage.
This system would develop over time to remove the need for handling
coins themselves, becoming a system of credit kept in books.</p>
<p>As the plague ravaged late medieval Europe, and the Hundred Years War
furthered the bloodshed, the lack of readily available labor pushed the
value of labor up. At the same time, due to the reintroduction of trade,
peasant laborers on nobles’ lands were trading away their requirement
for physical service to one instead fulfilled by a money payment,
motivating the peasants to work to generate extra capital which they
could keep for themselves.</p>
<p>With credit becoming easier to access, and peasants being motivated
to earn their own money and pay it like a tax to their noble, the world
underwent a commercial revolution. The result of this revolution was
joint stock companies, the decline of usury as a negative, and the rise
of credit and banks as institutions. These institutions, along with the
desire for resources and earning capital, helped to drive British and
other European powers to colonize the new world, establishing their
dominant place in the global financial sector, and by extension,
spreading Christian ethics, representative governments, and commercial
banking systems across the world, becoming engines through which other
medieval concepts have spread across the globe.</p>
<p>In today’s world, there are few countries in the developed world
which lack a representative government, most of which are based on
European systems of representative government. The UN declaration of
Human Rights enshrines the idea of inalienable human rights based on
ideas developed in Europe, and most countries in the world use some form
of civil law which has at its heart the Justinian Code rediscovered
during the medieval era. The modern banking and credit system is the
backbone of globalization and international trade. The impact of these
ideas on the modern world is profound. Banking, representative
institutions, and the western moral and legal systems are continuations
and challenges from the medieval civilizations which lie at the heart of
modern, global society.</p>

<p>The medieval world is thought of as many different things to many
different people. Two of the dominant views of the Middle Ages are: an
ignorant dark age of barbarism and violence, or a glorious golden age of
Christian civilization. I believe these are better thought of as the
rough ‘start’ and ‘peak’ of the Middle Ages. First, I will explain what
each of these terms means, and then I will explain how they act as the
start and peak of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>The medieval world is described by some as a ‘dark age’, filled with
ignorance and barbarity. This is incorrect when applied to the whole of
the Middle Ages but is an accurate assessment of the early Middle Ages.
This is because the early Middle Ages grew from the ashes of the Roman
Empire. Among the people living in the ruins of the Empire, memories
still existed of a time of literacy, laws, and culture. Those who ruled
lands and some within burgeoning religious communities were trying to
hold onto what knowledge they could, but it was fragmented and limited.
Germanic tribes overwhelmed Roman cities, planting the seeds of medieval
kingdoms and modern European states. Kingdoms such as the Franks were
created in this period, and converted to Christianity under King Clovis
I. However, King Clovis was hardly a Christian in practice, but rather a
warrior king who converted in the midst of battle. The Frankish writer
Gregory of Tours, who wrote on Clovis’ life, describes the era as one
where churches were taken and looted, pillaged, and other atrocities.
Another reason for the term ‘dark age’ comes from Gregory, that there
was a lack of written sources, due to the focus on day-to-day life out
of necessity from the collapse of the trade networks of the Roman
Empire; few had the time to write, and those who did were more focused
on transcribing works like the Bible over writing histories of their
time.</p>
<p>This perception is only partially correct. The Kings were certainly
not the best Christians, violence certainly was common, but there were
steps in the direction of what would become the Golden Age of Christian
Civilization. The Church’s teachings were spreading, people were
converting, monasteries were being built, and people like St. Boniface
were working to convert the Germans. The people were adjusting to life
without the Roman state to support them; farming was changing and
evolving, and with it the organization of society. Life was becoming
more focused around local lords who held immense power over their serfs,
negotiations were worked out where in exchange for protection the
leaders got food and supplies. There may have been few new books
written, but innovation was under way. Ignorance was not a choice but a
necessity as those living in the medieval world lacked the time or
ability to access the vast oceans of knowledge of the ancient world and
were instead focused on immediate problems and immediate solutions.</p>
<p>The perception of the Middle Ages as a ‘Golden Age’ of Christen
Civilization is similarly accurate. This perception comes from the high
Middle Ages, which stretches from the 11<sup>th</sup> to mid
13<sup>th</sup> centuries. In this period, Christian Civilization as a
whole was relatively unified in Western Europe under one church, whose
leader, the pope, was able to call upon the armies of Europe for a
crusade for the Holy Land. In doing so, riches and knowledge were
brought back to Europe. In that time the Church was able to wield a
great deal of power, political, economic, and military, through the
Papal States and greater medieval Christendom. This is the period when
the great gothic cathedrals begin their construction, reform movements
seeking a more equal church which truly reflects the values which its
followers and holy book said it ought to follow begin to arise.</p>
<p>However, this period was not without its issues. Medieval rulers
still fought against the Church, challenging its supremacy within their
borders, such as Philip IV’s political struggles with the papacy over
the investiture conflict. The Church was divided between the Orthodox
and Latin sides, with differences which would only grow over time.
Furthermore, this period is still characterized by great wars beyond the
crusades, such as the Hundred Years’ war.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the high Middle Ages could only have
been achieved as a result of the groundwork laid by the ‘Dark Age’ which
preceded it. Farming innovations allowed for more food to be produced by
progressively fewer and fewer people, while allowing those who were
farming greater yields from which they could profit. Those who did not
have to farm could diversify their labor further still, offering skills
to their feudal lords. These specializations would over time develop
into the famous guilds of the High Middle Ages. The Church also
benefitted from the advancements made in the ‘Dark Ages’, as it built
itself upon the dark ages’ spread of Christianity through its various
rulers. As well, it was a result of the monks and monasteries supported
by the early medieval kings which kept writing alive, and it was rulers
like Charlemagne who sponsored Alcuin who created Carolingian miniscule,
the basis of many modern fonts. As well, in this period there was a
great merging of Christian ideas with Roman and Greek concepts revived
by the crusades bringing with it a death to the ignorance of the ‘Dark
Ages’; replacing it with the light of knowledge, drawing many a monk to
study like a moth to a flame.</p>
<p>It is because of this, the evolution which is undergone between the
‘Dark Ages’ of the early Middle Ages, in the shadow of the Roman Empire,
to the ‘Golden Age’ of Christian civilization, shining bright from its
beacon beyond the Alps, that I believe the terms are broad ideas for
defining the start and high points of Medieval civilization. Neither
properly encompasses the depth of change which Europe underwent in the
Middle Ages, but neither is inaccurate for describing a part of the
Middle Ages. Instead, both views are needed to understand the
development of the Medieval World.</p>

<p>Three major factors which impacted European civilization from 1300 to
1500, causing the transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance and
start of modern age are: changes in religion, the plague, and the
closing of the Medieval frontier.</p>
<p>Norman Cohn argues that from the end of the 11<sup>th</sup> century
to the first half of the 16<sup>th</sup> century, some of the poor in
Europe sought to improve their living conditions and bring about a
paradise on Earth. This was based on the early Christian and Jewish
prophecy which says that the final stage of the world will have all of
humanity at once perfectly good and perfectly happy. Across generations
there was an idea that <em>this</em> would be the one in which Christ’s
final struggle would occur. Their goal was to bring about that perfect
good and happy world by “destroying the agents of corruption.” This was
most popular among those living on the margins of society, which
increased with the closing of the Medieval frontier discussed later,
those “who were not simply poor but who could find no assured and
recognized place in society at all,” were drawn to found a community
where they belonged, “driven on by a wild enthusiasm born of
desperation.” These would be further motivated by whenever a calamity
would hit Europe and disrupt that generation’s life; whether it be a
crusade or the plague, there was always something rocking the foundation
and pushing those on the margins of society together, and towards more
extreme views against their authorities.</p>
<p>Support for these groups grew as the clergy across Europe were
exposed for their worldliness, angering the laity, especially the
poorest people on the margins. All the Church’s talk of enduring
hardship and poverty becomes harder to bear for a pauper looking upon
churchmen with full bellies at gilded tables, while the watcher’s
stomach grumbles. As the Middle Ages continued, in periods of rebellion
and revolution the marginalized groups would seize their chance and
found anarcho-communes safe from corruption, from which they could
preach to the world of the coming end times. Through these short-lived
rebellions, the monarch’s authority deteriorated, and it became harder
to ignore the demands of these marginalized people.</p>
<p>One important event which upset European society and galvanized many
of the previously mentioned marginalized religious groups, was the
spread of the Black Death. According to Giovanni Boccaccio, who lived
through the plague, its arrival in a city or town caused people to
abandon their jobs, children and families, and other obligations. It
spread quickly and caused great mayhem in the cities which it effected.
The deaths from the plague lead to a labor shortage in many medieval
jobs, as the previously nearly overpopulated Europe quickly found itself
with fewer mouths to feed, and an even smaller supply of people to grow
and feed them, allowing those who remained to demand a higher price for
their labor.</p>
<p>This increase in labor value would not come overnight, but the plague
certainly seemed to spread to many a peasant. Furthermore, this plague
had no specific group whom it targeted, it seemed to affect everyone,
including animals. It spread quickly by contact with the infected or an
item they had touched. These two facts together inspired many of those
people who were fleeing towns fearing the plague to believe it to be the
end times, leading to them starting or joining one of the religious
groups mentioned before.</p>
<p>Both factors were compounded by the third factor: the closing of the
medieval frontier. In an article with the same name, Archibald Lewis
argues that the medieval world had both an internal and external
frontier, whose eventual loss would help in creating the modern
world.</p>
<p>The internal frontier Lewis describes is “one of forest, marsh, moor
and fen,” an untamed wilderness whose resources were used to construct
buildings, tools for trade, and weapons of war. It was to here that
peasants who were on the margins and grew fed up with medieval society
could flee and found a new life.</p>
<p>The external frontier was the land being conquered and claimed by the
European leaders, the land warred and fought over, colonized, and
settled. This frontier was ventured into by the lesser children of
nobles, setting off to find their own lands and realms to rule over.</p>
<p>It was on these expanded lands that agriculture prospered, feeding
the ever expanding, commercializing, and urbanizing population. However,
when land to expand into ran out, those lesser nobles could no longer
claim land. The peasants who hid in the internal frontiers were pushed
out as monarchs brought in forest laws to protect their wood supplies
and other resources. These actions pushed those marginalized people
together in their anger with the current world. At the same time,
increasing populations across Europe put undue strain on the agriculture
systems to feed everyone. Furthermore, the glut of people devalued
labor. This led to a clearer separation based on class, as those with
means and access were able to multiply their wealth while those without
were left further and further on the margins of society.</p>
<p>These factors are exacerbated with the Black Death, whose spread
destroyed towns and terrified those who survived. As a result, the value
of labor increased, decreasing the number of people marginalized in
society. At the same time, the Catholic Church became unable to bear the
attacks from the marginalized groups, and its own issues became too much
to bear, becoming another piece of tinder in the sparking of the
protestant reformation. Finally, those nobles and peasants who needed
land and resources to deal with the ever-increasing population now had
much more land and resources to use, and fewer people to share those
resources with. At the same time, social relations were being
recalibrated as the wealth of peasants increased due to their ability to
demand higher wages. These factors, the Black Death, the changes in
religion, and the closing of the Medieval frontier, together played a
vital role in bringing about the Modern age.</p>
