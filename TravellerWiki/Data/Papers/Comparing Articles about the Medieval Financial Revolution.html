<p>At the end of the 17<sup>th</sup> century, following the Glorious
Revolution in England, another, arguably more important, revolution was
beginning to take hold: the financial revolution, which would bring with
it cheap and less restricted credit, allowing the English economy to
grow into a powerhouse. This revolution was based on the tools and
systems which arose in the Middle Ages in response to usury laws. The
evolution of usury and credit into modern financial instruments is
explored through the following three articles: “An Economic Model for
the Medieval Church: Usury as a Form of Rent Seeking” by Robert Ekelund,
et al., “Money, Banking, and Credit in Medieval Bruges” by Raymond de
Roover, and lastly John H. Munro’s “The Medieval Origins of the
Financial Revolution: Usury, Rentes, and Negotiability.”</p>
<p>This paper examines each article, starting with an explanation of the
thesis of the article, followed by a summary of the article’s contents,
and finally examining the evidence given for each article: what sources
and arguments does each article use to support its thesis. After
examining the articles individually, the similarities between the
articles will then be discussed, highlighting the eventual development
of credit, and the way that these medieval institutions are still
visible in the world today.</p>
<p>The first article is “An Economic Model for the Medieval Church:
Usury as a Form of Rent Seeking” by Robert Ekelund, Robert Hebert, and
Robert Tollison. The thesis of the article is that the Catholic Church
had a monopoly on offering salvation to the people of Western Europe,
and that the Church tried to maintain that monopoly using a combination
of doctrinal purity, regulations against certain practices, and
corporeal agents.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The article then demonstrates its
thesis using usury as an example. The article details the Church’s
relationship to usury laws, explaining how various councils and popes
influenced the development of the cannon concept of usury.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The
article then provides an explanation of how the Church had a “pattern of
select enforcement” around the usury doctrine, enforcing it only when
“it was in the Church’s interest to do so.”<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> One
such example is the Medicis, whose usurious activities the Church
ignored, while supporting the banking family in other ways, such as by
making them the exclusive agents in overseeing the production from a
major aluminium mine, then working with the Medicis to get rid of other
competition in that industry.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The article then
summarizes the Church’s position in the loan market as “operat[ing] on
both sides,” borrowing freely from its bankers, offering usurious loans
in private, all “while outwardly declaring public usurers anathema.”<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The primary sources used in the article are Vatican records, as well
as other official documentation from the Church. However, as noted in
the article, the conclusions reached are those of trained economists,
and not theologians. A result of this is that an economist tends to look
for economic answers, which the article highlights by offering two
possible hypotheses: one spiritual and one economic. The two hypotheses
are referred to throughout the article, though the dominant view is the
economic view, and the spiritual view is merely offered without much
analysis. A variety of secondary sources are used throughout the article
as well, with two reoccurring names being Nelson and Lunt, though others
come up as well to add further support to the topic, including the
author whose article will be discussed next: De Roover.</p>
<p>“Money, Banking, and Credit in Medieval Bruges” by Raymond de Roover
explains “the three different classes of money-dealers: the Italian
merchant-bankers, the lombards, and the money-changers.”<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The
article’s thesis is that credit played a vital role in the medieval
economy, and that the three classes of money dealers each found their
own ways to subvert usury laws, thus turning a profit on interest. The
article makes clear that these money-dealers did not arise until the
13<sup>th</sup> century, and the pre-13<sup>th</sup> century loans were
generally done by monasteries.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The article then goes on
to explain how the Italian bankers got started in Bruges, (having been
granted trade privileges), and explaining the structures of two
competing banks, before finally detailing the use of bills of exchange,
and the way in which the bill could return a profit for the banker. A
bill of exchange was a way to transfer money between cities without
having to physically transport gold, while avoiding usury laws by not
knowing when the banker would be paid, and by using differences in
currencies’ exchange rates to further enhance the bankers’ profit.<a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> The next group examined are the
pawnbrokers, known as lombards, who rather than finding a crafty way to
avoid the negative connotations of being a manifester of usury, chose
instead to embrace their title and get special privileges to “lend
“money for more money.””<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> The last group looked at in this
article is that of the money-changers. The first important distinction
De Roover notes for the money changers is in their status as citizens
and thus their eligibility for municipal offices. The second important
distinction was that their position was seen as a “quasi-public
function,” due to the requirement that they take an oath of office and
follow monetary ordinances.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> The article then
details the way that the money-changers made money: by offering a bank
account where people could deposit bullion that the bank could loan out;
by acting as the go between from the mint to the people; and by
facilitating payment in the form of bank deposits, which effectively
acted as a bank note.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The evidence for “Money, Banking, and Credit in Medieval Bruges” is
officially none, as the only citation in the paper says that it contains
no references to sources,”<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> but that the author
will give the facts and supporting evidence in a more extensive study
that was set to come out in the future. However, the author does
reference different primary sources that while uncited, are the basis of
much of the article’s argument. For the Italian bankers, the article
details the way in which the bill of exchange was used to earn a profit,
effectively using the conceptual bill of exchange and the logic on which
it operated as the primary source for this section. The pawnbrokers
primary source is the license they were granted to conduct their trade,
as well as the receipts that they gave to those who pawned an item.<a
href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The money-changers have the most
detailed sources, as Bruges’ archive had the account books of two
different changers. These account books allowed De Roover to examine and
explain various facets of the money-changers trade, including the use of
deposits as transferable currency, the relationship between changer and
mint, and the probability that one in thirty-five to forty people may
have had a bank account.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Further evidence is
provided for these conclusions through the use of a map of the city,
which De Roover makes several references to, explaining the relationship
between location and the industries which the various credit-extending
groups assisted. Interestingly, one other conclusion reached through the
map is in the difference between the pawnbroker and money-changer. De
Roover explains that the pawnbroker needed a larger house to store the
various pawned goods, while a money-changer would have lost trust had
they entered the pawning business, and thus only needed a relatively
small house.</p>
<p>The third article is “The Medieval Origins of the Financial
Revolution: Usury, Rentes, and Negotiability” by John H. Munro. The
thesis of this article is following the interplay between rentes and
usury through the Middle Ages into the late 17<sup>th</sup> century. The
article details how usury laws pushed rentes to evolve over time in
various forms in the future Dutch Republic, starting with an explanation
of the history of usury laws, the distinction between rentes which were
licit and those which were usurious.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> The article goes on to
explain how the Flemish had two forms of rentes: a perpetual hereditary
rent, and a newer life-rent.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> These two rentes would
be the basis of future investment tools for municipal and eventually
national governments. The article then details the rise of banking in
the Low Countries, and the issuing of Rentes to fund municipal actions
leading to the creation of secondary financial markets.<a href="#fn17"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
The next key development is in negotiability. This development was
brought on by the English, who had a strong royal monopoly on money
changing and trade in bullion, which in turn prevented England from
developing private bank deposits like those in Flanders until the
1640s.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> This change accelerated following
the creation of Lex Mercantoria around the 1280s.<a href="#fn19"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
The Law Merchant created a shared legal system between the Dutch
Republic and Britain for trade, which was helpful given the two’s
economic interdependence.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Then, following the
Glorious Revolution, William of Orange brought with him a system of
long-term borrowing which the English state could adopt.<a href="#fn21"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
The article then explains how the debts created by this system were
consolidated “into the Consolidated Stock of the Nation, popularly known
as Consols.”<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> The paper ends by explaining the
continued existence of Consols into the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and the
optimistic observation that: “the responses to the prohibition of usury
promoted rather than retarded European economic progress.”<a
href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Munro uses many sources in comparison to the previous two articles,
with every page having at least one, if not many more, sources to back
up the arguments presented. The article does little of its own
arguments, acting more as a summary of the financial revolution than an
argument about any specific part of the revolution. The secondary
sources include references to De Roover’s work, including “Money,
Banking, and Credit in Medieval Bruges” when Munro explains the way that
a bill of exchange worked. Most of the secondary sources were published
after the second World War, with some being published as recently as
2001 and others being published in the mid 19<sup>th</sup> century. The
article builds on a variety of primary sources, from papal edicts to
town record, as well as other primary sources from the 12<sup>th</sup>
century onwards to explain the financial revolution.</p>
<p>In comparing the three articles, two themes emerge: that the Church’s
belief in usury was only an impediment in the development of credit, one
for which work arounds could be found, and that as a result, the
foundation of the modern financial system can be found in the Middle
Ages.</p>
<p>The key area on which all three articles agree is that the Church’s
ban on usury did not stop the development of tools for credit, it only
slowed down their development for the common person. In “An Economic
Model” it is explained how the Church exploited their monopoly on
salvation to selectively enforce usury laws, allowing the Church to
benefit from credit during periods like the Crusades while also allowing
the Church to restrict the growth of competition by preventing
competition from getting credit.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> In effect the Church
did not prevent the development of economic tools; it merely attempted
to monopolize their existence. This monopoly was shown to be
unsuccessful by de Roover in “Money, Banking, and Credit in Medieval
Bruges,” as de Roover lays out three different ways in which non-church
members were able to create credit, whether through bills of exchange,
outright usurious pawn brokering, or through the bullion trade. De
Roover’s analysis ends by confirming the vitality of credit to the
medieval commercial centers, and thus the Church’s failure to enforce
its monopoly.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Finally, Munro’s work is on the
whole supportive of the concept of the slowdown, in its earliest pages
working to dispel the myth “that the ban (on usury) had no effect on
medieval trade and finance”<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> by spending the rest
of the article discussing the evolution that medieval trade and finance
undertook to get around the ban on usury.</p>
<p>As a result, all three articles demonstrate the eventual shift from
usury to credit, and in doing so, each article demonstrates how their
chosen topic has ramifications into the modern world. In “An Economic
Model”, it is made clear by applying the modern concept of rent seeking
behavior to the medieval practice of usury, as well as explaining how
through the developments of the eighth and ninth centuries, the medieval
Church created a series of institutions which resemble practices in the
modern business world, to maintain their monopoly on salvation.<a
href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> De Roover is more explicit in the
connection between the medieval and modern worlds, saying: “It is
therefore not true that the failure to invent the bank note hampered the
development of capitalism in the Middle Ages,”<a href="#fn28"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
as bank deposits performed the same function as bank notes. Munro makes
this point, that the lack of bank note did not hamper the development of
capitalism. Munro does this by explicitly tracing the development of
capitalism from the early Rentes to the eventual development of the
British Consols, and that the bill of exchange is not gone, it has
instead evolved into “international ‘acceptances’” that are essential
for modern commerce and finance.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>De Roover’s work is detailed and specific, focusing on one area, and
one concept, but examining each part of that concept with some,
ultimately limited, depth. Ekelund et al. are broader in their study,
approaching the broad concept of the Church’s monopoly on salvation and
then applying that monopoly to a single area to view its effects. In
doing so, Ekelund expands on the circumstances in which de Roover’s
money-dealers operated. The connecting piece for the two is in Munro’s
analysis. Taking a large overview of a wide period across a wide area,
Munro gives the broad stroke analysis of key events in the evolution
from the medieval economic system to the modern one. This overview
allows for de Roover’s money-dealers to be put into context with
Ekelund’s monopolistic Church relative to the overall development of
financial systems, as the money-dealers become a necessary piece in
subverting the Church’s monopoly through an evolving legal understanding
of usury.</p>
