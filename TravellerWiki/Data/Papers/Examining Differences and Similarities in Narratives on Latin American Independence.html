<p>Tutino’s edited volume, <em>New Countries</em> (2016) and
Blumenthal’s book <em>Exile and Nation-State Formation in Argentina</em>
(2019) both discuss the topic of nation-state formation in
post-independence Central and South America; however, the two books take
different approaches to exploring this topic. This paper will discuss
some of the similarities and differences in the approaches taken in the
aforementioned books. The books broadly differ in three areas: the area
of the topic being covered – Blumenthal focuses on Argentina and Chile
whereas Tutino takes a broader look at all of South and Central America;
the approach taken for that topic – Blumenthal presents a social history
focusing on several members of the intellectual elite who went into
exile while Tutino provides a more general national history; finally,
the choice of who to focus on as the ‘protagonists’ of the narrative –
Blumenthal uses a recurring ‘cast’ of exiles who are discussed in each
chapter, while the sections of Tutino’s volume discuss a variety of
figures, usually focusing on those linked to key events in that nation’s
history.</p>
<p>Tutino’s edited sections provide a general history for the countries
of Central and South America, from Mexico to the Andean heartland and
further south. Its primary focus is the period of independence,
providing the national history for each nation or region that it
discusses. An example of this is the background in the chapter: <em>From
one Patria, Two Nations in the Andean Heartland</em> where Chambers
discusses the history of the Andean peoples gathered around Lake
Titicaca, from their start “almost four thousand years ago”<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> to the eventual creation of Peru and
Bolivia, and how the creation of those nations inadvertently prevented
the creation of a united Andean heartland. To explain how that
transition happens, authors in various sections provide a broad national
history, discussing topics from key military victories and revolutions,
important social players, and movements, to the economy and the role
that the transition to industrial capitalism played in the formation of
these nation-states. An example of this is in the chapter <em>Becoming
Mexico</em>, wherein the vitality of Mexico to the world economy is made
readily apparent, as its silver was part of what “stimulated the global
trades for centuries”.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The chapter later discusses how a
drop in the global silver trade due to Napoleon’s destruction of the
Spanish empire coincides with the Mexican economy’s downfall, and the
empire’s collapse created space for independence, which would only be
stabilized decades after it was initially achieved, in part thanks to
funding from British banks and investors in exchange for low tariffs and
recognition as a country,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> showcasing the connections between
industrial capitalism and national development. Tutino’s sections also
provide a variety of stories focusing on more minor individuals related
to the nations they’re discussing, such as the important uprisings led
by Túpac Amaru,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> but also others who worked alongside
the well-known events and leaders, such as Tupaj Katari who was fighting
a similar fight as Túpac Amaru during the same period.<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>
Thus the sections of <em>New Countries</em> present various nations’
histories, through a broad overview of different factors while examining
different actors who played a role in each nation’s history, rarely
having a person who appears in multiple chapters outside of key figures
for the entire continent like Simón Bolívar.</p>
<p>In contrast, Blumenthal’s <em>Exile and Nation-State Formation in
Argentina and Chile</em> provides a focused look at the impact exiles
had on the formation of nations in South America, especially Argentina
and Chile. The book does not focus on the national narrative of what
occurred in these countries, or the events leading up to or after
independence; instead, it focuses on the exile experience, the jobs
exiles worked, and the role exiles played in the creation of new
countries which they saw themselves as citizens of, and in some cases
would become the future leaders of.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Because of this focus on
the exile experience the book does not discuss the larger economies of
Chile or Argentina; instead it focuses on the local economies that
allowed exiles to stay employed and spread their ideas. For example, the
third chapter discusses the way that existing colonial-commercial
networks were used to spread political texts and act as commercial
enterprises for some thinkers in exile, detailing how J. M. Gutierrez
was key in the creation of a thriving literary exchange among various
exiles across Central and South America.<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
This example is emblematic of the entire book, as it introduces several
key ‘characters’ in chapter one, and then goes on to often re-reference
them later throughout various chapters in the construction of a larger
narrative: the exile narrative and the personal story for each of the
discussed exiles. Whether talking about the familial relationships and
how some families had developed a history of exile, with multiple
generations having gone into exile, such as the Bilbao family,<a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> or the painful loneliness of being
an exile, the book’s primary focus is on exiles and their impact in the
creation of new republics out of the countries they initially fled, not
on the overarching history of those countries.</p>
<p>Comparing the two books, there are some key similarities and
differences between them. The largest differences between the two are in
scope and scale, while the largest similarity is demonstrating the
interconnectivity of the emerging countries in the period after
independence in South American history.</p>
<p>When looking at the scope of the two books, the largest difference
becomes glaringly obvious: Tutino’s book covers a wide spectrum of
countries, whereas Blumenthal is focusing on Argentina and Chile, with
mentions of other countries and the role they played in the exile life,
such as Peru, Uruguay, and Bolivia. As well, the scope of what history
itself is covered is different in the books, with each section of
Tutino’s work discussing a different nation and providing its history
from pre-colonization through to the early post-independence period, and
while tying its history into a series of established themes, like the
silver trade and slavery. Blumenthal, by contrast focuses on the exile
experience and uses various events throughout the post-independence
period as springboards for further study of various exiles and their
actions, such as referencing events that caused new waves of exiles, or
the revolutions that brought them back to their homes. In this same vein
is the scale of what history is covered in the two books, with the
nature of each topic’s impact being the degree to which it effects the
greater world. The exiles’ impact on the development of various
republican institutions, while important, has a smaller effect on the
whole of South America, whereas the scale of various national histories
is quite grand, but the specifics of each are less clear. For example,
it is shown in Blumenthal how exiles helped in creating a national
spirit for freedom of the press,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> a relatively small part
of the greater national idea, versus Tutino discussing the vitality of
the silver trade to the global economy shows the difference in scale,
i.e. social-transnational history versus global-national history.</p>
<p>The largest similarity between the two books is in their shared
reaffirmation of the interconnectivity of the proto-nations that were
forming in post-independence South America. Blumenthal demonstrates this
by discussing how various exiles came to form national associations or
societies. These groups would then negotiate on the international stage
– sometimes acting as a government in exile - such as the Argentine
Commission of Montevideo negotiating an alliance with President Rivera
of Uruguay or working with the French to blockade Buenos Aires.<a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Tutino’s sections, on the other
hand, show their interconnectivity both through a shared narrative of
liberation in Simón Bolívar, or the connectivity of slave trade; the
rise of Haiti causing a decline of the sugar trade and slave importation
creating a gap that Brazil was able to fill, turning it into what in
British circles was known as “the slave trade personified.”<a
href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Both books are thus able to
demonstrate the interconnectivity of South America in the
post-independence period: through letter writing, military campaign,
economies, legal systems, history, or any other number of
similarities.</p>
<p><em>Exile and Nation-State Formation in Argentina and Chile</em> and
<em>New Countries Capitalism, Revolutions, and Nations in the Americas,
1750-1870</em> both offer insights into Central and South America in the
period after independence but do so in different ways. Where
<em>Exile</em> provides a social history looking at the titular exiles
and their experience in different countries, <em>New Countries</em>
shows the national and international histories that led to the creation
of the countries that the exiles were fleeing from, to, and helping to
create. They do this by exploring their respective themes at different
scopes and scales, while keeping the interconnectivity of the fledgling
countries at the forefront of their writing.</p>
