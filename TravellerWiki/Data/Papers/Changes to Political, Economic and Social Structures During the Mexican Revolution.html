<p>The Mexican Revolution was a period in the early twentieth century
when Mexico underwent a radical political, economic, and social
transformation. This paper will trace the steps taken during the Mexican
Revolution to change the political, economic, and social structures
which governed Mexican life. This will be accomplished by examining each
area’s structure during the Porfiriato, the transition the structure
undergoes during the various revolutions and counter revolutions through
to the passing of the Constitution of 1917, the enforcement of the new
Constitution by President Calles, and the final revolutionary changes
applied by President Cardenas.</p>
<p>The first structure which will be looked at is the political
structure. The Porfiriato was the period of Mexican history when
Porfirio Diaz was in power. Diaz claimed to be a liberal leader, but his
policies pointed towards a focus on stability and order, at the
expensive of actual liberal policy.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The focus on stability
was part of a plan to attract foreign businesses, a plan that also
included offering special concessions to entice the foreign companies to
develop in Mexico.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> These concessions helped to develop
the railway network throughout Mexico, which also served as a tool to
maintain order as it allowed for the quick transportation of troops to
areas with worker strikes or other forms of dissent.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> A
large area where Diaz’s rule was at odds with liberal policy can be seen
in Diaz’s comfortable treatment of the Church, compared to the liberal
anti-clerical measures which were in the 1857 Constitution.<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> By and large, the political
structure of the Porfiriato was one of a client-patron relationship
built around the strongman Diaz.</p>
<p>This structure began coming apart following a TV interview wherein
Diaz admitted to considering stepping down and allowing free
elections.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> This inspired many different groups
to begin to develop political clubs, which eventually coalesced around
Madero who was advocating for “free elections and proclaimed the
no-re-election principle.”<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> However, during his
tenure as President, Madero failed to reward the revolutionaries who had
gotten him into power – either with positions in his government or with
reforms that they had been asking for – and instead supported the
previous elites, and promised only political reform to the people, not
social or economic reform.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Real political change came following the Constitutional Convention of
1916 and rise of President Calles. Calles hoped to prevent future
elections from being as violent, allowing for a smoother transfer of
power. He did this through the creation of the Patrido Nacional
Revolucionario (PNR), which would pick the next president, and help them
carry out their political goals by controlling politics, while keeping
the political elite in power and, most importantly, letting Calles hold
onto control from the background.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> It did this by
“work[ing] hand and glove with the government to maintain a political
elite in power through patronage and corruption, downsizing the military
and controlling political opponents through electoral fraud, violence,
and manipulation of the judiciary.”<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The final step in the political development of post-revolutionary
Mexico was under President Cardenas. Cardenas wanted to stop being a
puppet of Calles and take the Party – and nation – in a more
progressive, nationalistic direction.<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
To get out of his puppet status, Cardenas worked hard to build
coalitions out of the various factions, which helped to centralize the
government in Mexico City.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> To secure his power,
Cardenas pushed for term limits in the Supreme Court, and pushed out
legislators who went against his policies.<a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
He also reformed the PNR into the new Partido de la Revolucion Mexicana,
which now gave representation to various sectors of the economy,
allowing them a greater voice in national politics.<a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The political structure was not the only structure which changed
during the revolution to give various sectors and people a greater
voice; the structure of the economy also underwent a transformation. The
Porfiriato was focused on economic modernization with little care for
how this was done, except for the belief that Mexico could not bring
about modernization without foreign ‘help’.<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
An example of this is Molina in the Yucatan, who was able to gain what
was essentially a monopoly on the henequen trade through a deal made
with an American company, without consideration for the loss of land of
the people living there, or the greater economic ramifications of such a
monopoly.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Such consolidations of land is one
of the key areas of resentment visible within the Plan de Ayala, which
did not seek to abolish private property, only to distribute the
holdings in a more equal way.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Madero’s and other early revolutionary governments failure to follow
through on the Plan de Ayala ultimately led to the Constitution of 1917,
which included two major areas of economic reform. The first was Mexican
control of its subsoil rights, advocated for by the Jacobinos based on
clauses from the 1857 Constitution which had been carried forward into
the new Constitution of 1917, and would eventually culminate in Article
27.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> The second was an expansion of
labor rights, visible in Article 123 of the Constitution, which tasked
the state with ensuring a fair wage for workers, workers’ rights in
general, one day of rest per week, and other benefits.<a href="#fn18"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>President Obregon expanded the governments relationship with Labor.
Beginning when he was serving as a General to Carranza, Obregon used Red
Battalions with union soldiers in them to defeat Pancho Villa.<a
href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> The relationship went much further
during Obregon’s time as president, as he worked closely with Luis
Morones, head of the Confederacion Regional de Obreros Mexicanos (CROM)
– a relationship Calles would expand on by making Morones his Minister
of Industry – but Morones did not look out for the workers, working
instead to enrich himself and his allies.<a href="#fn20"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Greater economic reform occurred under President Cardenas. He was
committed to giving land to the people – giving more than any other
revolutionary leader in this period.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> He also worked with
disgruntled labor leaders who had been left out of CROM, leading to the
formation of the Confederacion de Trajadores Mexicanos (CTM) which
limited CROM to mostly urban areas and the textile industry.<a
href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> Cardenas also expropriated the
petrol industry, creating the state owned Petroleos Mexicanos.<a
href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The social revolution was based on the anti-clerical clauses of the
1857 Constitution, and expanded on in the 1917 Constitution, which gave
the state the ability to intervene in religious affairs.<a href="#fn24"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>
Calles pushed the religious reforms further, due to his fanatical hatred
of the Roman Catholic Church.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> These reforms
culminated in the Cristos Rebellion, which ended in 1929 with an
agreement that the government would not enforce its anti-clerical laws
in a way hostile to the Church.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>A second area of social change was education. Under Cardenas there
was a large push for secular, nationalistic education. It focused on
teaching mothers skills they needed to live healthier and more secular
lives, but the goal “was not to emancipate women and children, but to
subordinate the household to the interest of national development.”<a
href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Initially resistant, rural towns
sometimes went so far as to kill the teachers who came to them, but over
time the teachers and conservative towns reached agreements to allow
secular education in certain times.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> The teachers and state
also worked to replace religious holidays with civic ones to help people
develop a greater sense of nationalism.<a href="#fn29"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Another area of social change to facilitate the growth of nationalism
was through anti-Chinese racism.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> As the Mexican
government’s racial goal became one of Mestizaje, the government was
able to present Chinese people as a lesser ‘other’ who were at fault for
some of Mexico’s problems, there by uniting the Mexican citizens against
a common enemy.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
