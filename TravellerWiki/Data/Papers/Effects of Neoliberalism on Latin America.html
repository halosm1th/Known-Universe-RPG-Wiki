<p>Latin America has been described as one of the most unequal places in
the world. In this area, the Gini index of the bottom 90% of the
population is comparable to other countries of a similar level of
development, but when factoring in the top 10%, the economic inequality
skyrockets.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> This paper will explore how
inequality has evolved in Latin America from the late 1970s to the early
2000s, as well as which social groups benefited the most and least from
this transition.</p>
<p>The period from the 1950s to the 1970s in Latin America saw the
region’s economy expand, and people were transitioning from the informal
economy into formal employment.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> This trend was reversed
during the 1980s through into the 2000s as the expansion in wealth and
income contracted. This allowed the top 10% of Mexicans to expand their
income by 20.8%, while that of the poorest fell by 23.2%, and the middle
class died off.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> This begs the question, what caused
such a dramatic change to occur, and allowed this consolidation of
wealth?</p>
<p>Greg Grandin argues this change was caused by the dual ‘successes’ of
the Chicago Boys in Chile, and the rise of Ronald Reagan who brought
with him the rise of neoliberalism. The Chicago Boys entered Chile after
President Nixon had the Chilean president deposed through economic
action, leading to Pinochet and a military Junta taking power, while
inflation spiraled out of control. To deal with inflation and other
economic issues, economists from the University of Chicago, including
Milton Friedman, were flown to Chile to give a talk on their recommended
free market “shock treatment” approach.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
This is the basis of the neoliberal economic system which came to
dominate Latin America and led to the massive levels of economic
inequality present in the region. “Shock Treatment” called for an end to
the printing of money to cut deficit spending, laying off government
employees, removing wage and price controls, privatizing state assets,
and deregulating the banking industry.<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>
This included the privatization of healthcare, pegging the Chilean
escudo to the U.S. dollar keeping it artificially high, and pushing
consumers and corporations to take on cheap foreign debt. This system
collapsed in on itself in 1982, leading to an IMF bailout, the further
privatization of state assets, and greater economic inequality as those
with wealth and connections in Chile, like other Latin American
countries when they had neoliberal policies, were able to buy up various
state properties and stash wealth away in foreign currencies.<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Chile would be the inspiration for many other Latin American
countries’ neoliberal policies during the 1980s and 1990s. This is
because during the 1970s third world debt spiraled out of control,
growing from $130 billion to $474 billion; meanwhile the U.S. dollar was
recovering, meaning the interest rate on debts denoted in USD were going
up, such that from 1980-1982 the value of the debt had increased by over
50%.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Latin American countries began to
risk defaults; they listened to the IMF, and followed Chile’s example of
neoliberalism. This created a new unconstrained global market, to act as
an arena instead of a global welfare state.<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> At
the same time, the selling of more than 2000 state enterprises
facilitated a massive transfer of wealth and power to those who were
already well connected: the Latin American super-billionaires or
multinational corporations.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Furthermore, after
George H. W. Bush began operation Just Cause to remove the dictator of
Panama, countries in Latin America knew what to fear if they did not
follow the American and IMF guidelines.<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
However, through the 1980s to the end of the 1990s, as Latin America
embraced the free market, inequality grew, actions like taxes changing
from progressive wealth-based income taxes to sales and payroll taxes
shifted the burden from the wealthy to the poor.<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>An example from this period is Argentina, who in 1991 followed in
Chiles’s footsteps, taking economic control from the government to an
independent body, tying its peso to the dollar, selling industries, etc.
This led to a recession, increase in unemployment and loss of state
services, but it was believed to be worth it as there was some
middle-class growth, the economy grew, and inflation fell.<a
href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> However this made Argentina
dependent on foreign currency to conduct trade with, putting it in a
negative trade balance with other countries, and giving it heavy loans
to repay. Argentina eventually was hit by a recession in 1998, leading
to a default on debt in 2002, the devaluing of the peso and a 58%
increase of people living under the poverty line.<a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Due to the failures of neoliberalism in Latin America, leftist
politicians like Hugo Chavez caught on in countries like Venezuela, as
they opposed the form of free trade pushed by the United States.<a
href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> At the same time, as economic
inequality has risen, people have turned to new ways to make money,
including the drug trade.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> In turn, the United
States’ war on drugs in Latin America has had a similar result as the
war on communism; an increase in the drug trade driven by the
environment imposed by the United States.<a href="#fn16"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The effects of neoliberalism can be clearly seen with its impacts on
various social groups. The top social class in urban areas, made up of
5-13% of the population, has almost all the capital, while the informal
sector who makes up 40-50% of the population has little money, job
security or protection, physical or economic.<a href="#fn17"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
This is believed to be because of the loss of jobs and decline in wages
as a result of the retreat of the state from personal lives as per
neoliberal policy.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> This is because as the formal
sector shrank in the 1990s following the cutting of government jobs, the
people transitioned into the informal sector.<a href="#fn19"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
Those pushed into the informal sector are excluded from modern
capitalist relations, and work in unregulated areas or for direct
subsistence, leading to a rise of petty bourgeoisie.<a href="#fn20"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>
However, up to 75% of the population are unable to earn enough income to
surpass the poverty level, implying that, “to be a worker in Latin
America means to be poor.”<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>As a result of the economic insecurity, many in Latin America have
turned to crime and the drug trade to get by.<a href="#fn22"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>
This is an issue which applies particularly to class in Latin America as
those with wealth are able to hire security and live in gated
communities, protected from the unequal and unstable world outside.<a
href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> Another class-based issue is
education, as education is skewed both by income and by gender, with
mostly middle or wealthy people getting an education, but especially not
poor women, leading to class and gender-based literacy gaps.<a
href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> The gap in education is further
compounded when emigration is taken into consideration, as those with
the education and skills to emigrate to the United States or elsewhere
often do so due to the better economic prospects.<a href="#fn25"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>
Once settled and earning money, the emigrants then often remit money to
their family, however due to the existing class boundaries on education
this money is mostly going to the middle and upper classes.<a
href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The social group most negatively impacted by neoliberal policies are
the women of color who work in the informal sector, are single mothers,
and who are the heads of their households. This is because women on
average get paid less, have worse working conditions, and less job
security then their male counterparts.<a href="#fn27"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>
As well, capitalist development has undermined women’s power in the
labor market by moving women away from agriculture and household
production to domestic service and manufacturing for the poor and less
educated women, but for middle or upper class educated women they tend
to move into higher paying white collar fields.<a href="#fn28"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
As well, women tend to have lower political participation, and female
headed households are more likely to be in poverty.<a href="#fn29"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Race in Latin America is a complicated concept, as it is conceptually
tied to class, and expressions of class such as dress, place of birth,
language, over physical skin colour.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> This has real world
effects, such as white people living on average 7 years longer, having a
25% better chancing of surviving infancy, four time as likely to finish
secondary school, less likely to go to prison or grow up in a favela,
and most likely going to be earning more than non-whites.<a href="#fn31"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
Even taking into consideration that racial ambiguity allows for
transitioning between races, there is still a clear class element to the
concept of race, with darker skinned people tending to be lower class
then lighter skinned people, even in countries which try and create a
generic identity such as Mexico.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, social group which is least desirable to be in would be a
single mother, who is a person of colour, informally employed, poor and
the head of her household, lacking education, from a rural area. On the
opposite end, the most desirable social group is married, white,
aristocratic, upper class, well educated, head of household, from a
gated urban area. This is because that group has access to more social,
political, and economic capital than any other, as well as the
connections both inter- and intra-national to be in the top 1% of Latin
Americans by wealth, Thus the most desirable group is insulated from the
day-to-day effects of neoliberalism, instead being able to benefit from
the long-term trend of increased inequality, as this group becomes more
unequal from the bottom 99%.</p>
