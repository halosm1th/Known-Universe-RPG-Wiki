<p>The Cuban Revolution was a radical transformation of Cuban society,
which was able to “[achieve] remarkably high health, education, and
other socioeconomic indicators that rival those of industrialized
countries.”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> However, the revolution was not
without its limits, a few of the key areas being: economic troubles,
disparities along racial and gender lines, and the housing and food
crises.</p>
<p>This paper will examine the key areas of success from the Cuban
Revolution, those of healthcare, education, and spreading revolutionary
ideas, as well as examining the key limitations of the revolution:
income distribution, race and gender issues, and housing and food
allocation.</p>
<p>The first area of success of the revolution that will be examined is
healthcare. As discussed by Becker, after the Revolution the healthcare
system underwent a boom, seeing a tenfold budget increase and free
healthcare for all. This, combined with increases in education, meant
the country was able to have a rate of one doctor per two hundred people
– and half those doctors were women.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Cuba’s medical miracle
resulted in Cuba having the highest density of doctors in Latin America,
a fact made more impressive because “there were only about 7,000 doctors
in the country [who] were primarily employed in the private sector, and
one third of them left the country during the first years of the
revolution.”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> This led to Cuba becoming a leader
in biotechnical research and medicine, while also assuming the role of a
hospital for the rest of Latin America, a place where those who could
not get treatment elsewhere could turn to for aid.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
Doctors also became key to Cuba’s foreign policy goals, as doctors were
sent to Venezuela for oil, and to other countries in Latin America in
exchange for foreign currency.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> However, the healthcare
system was not perfect, and the US embargo prevented certain basic
medicines from being readily accessible. As well, the Special Period in
the 1990s led to the deterioration of hospital infrastructure. <a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The medical boom was helped because “the revolutionaries quickly
built a strong education system.”<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The investment in
education saw a boost in literacy levels “from 76 percent before the
revolution to 96 percent in 1962, the highest in Latin America and a
level that equaled that of wealthy, industrialized countries.”<a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Additionally, by 1961 all schools in
Cuba had been made free.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> A primary goal of the changes was
raising the education level of and further integrating rural areas and
women into Cuban society.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> This was a success, as
practically all children up to the age of 17 were in school, and the
secondary education completion rate rose from 3.5 percent in 1953 to
38.7 in 1986.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Through the turbulent 1990s, women
represented 60 percent of enrollment in higher education.<a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
The Revolution had also ensured that blacks and mulattos “had roughly
similar access to … education.”<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> This focus on
education remained even after the economic slowdown began in the 1990s,
when a program was started which would “[have students] start working as
social workers with the possibility of studying at university at the
same time.”<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> This led to the popularization of
the idea of the “universalization of higher education.”<a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The Revolution was committed to its revolutionary ideals and worked
to export them into the world. Becker states that “Cuba pursued an
internationalist foreign policy,”<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> fighting with
anticolonialist movements in Africa, while inspiring revolutionary
movements closer to home.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Most notably in its
international efforts was the devotion of troops to help Angola fight
against South Africa, demonstrating that the better armed white forces
could be defeated.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Cuba pursued this policy for two reasons: first it helped them gain
allies abroad while demonstrating Cuban resilience and shaming the
United States, and second it helped in demonstrating the government’s
commitment to revolutionary ideas. The first reason is especially
important, as those allies helped prevent an American invasion of the
socialist island nation, and made the United States appear weak.<a
href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> The second reason is visible in the
opinion of Cuba and Moscow on one another: Castro had no issue removing
those loyal to Moscow from his government and following economic
policies which benefited Cuba to the detriment of the USSR, and the USSR
who “muttered about pouring funds down the Cuban rathole.”<a
href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> This devotion to revolutionary
spirit was recognized by Henry Kissinger, who described Castro as:
“probably the most genuine revolutionary leader then in power.”<a
href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>However, even the strongest revolutionary spirits run into
limitations imposed by reality. The Revolution succeeded in reducing
inequality in income distribution due to the Soviet Union buying Cuban
sugar for above market prices.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> Following the collapse
of the Soviet Union, income inequality has started to creep back in.
There are several reasons for this: family members living abroad who
send money to their family back in Cuba, racism in the tourism industry;
and investment in certain new areas of industry which get access to
government investment.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The rise in income inequality has exposed the limitations of the
Revolution with regards to race and gender issues. It was officially
declared that Cuba was without racism, however “international observers
agree that most tourist-related jobs are performed by individuals deemed
to be white in Cuba.”<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> This is “due to aesthetic
considerations and to the alleged preferences of the tourists.”<a
href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> As well, the majority of exiles
from Cuba are white, which in turn means that a majority of remittances
are from white families living abroad. These two factors push
Afro-Cubans “to activities that are perceived as either illegal or
unethical in order to access the dollar economy.”<a href="#fn26"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>A second set of limitations exist for women who like those in the
West, hit a glass ceiling in their jobs, which exacerbated inequalities
during the Special Period.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Attempts to legislate
equality in the household, through things like the Family Code of 1975,
have seen some success, especially thanks to their granting of near
equality of consensual union and legal marriage, and regulating an even
split of household chores between the family.<a href="#fn28"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
However, the greatest drivers of inequality and patriarchy are in the
allocation of housing and food.</p>
<p>Cuba has struggled to build housing for its revolutionary population
but there has been great progress made in modernizing the existing homes
– bringing in utilities like plumbing and electricity.<a href="#fn29"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>
But, the lack of housing, and the corruption in the housing system has
led to the rise of shanty towns, and as income inequality increased
during the Special Period, so too did the inequality between the genders
for those living in the shanty towns – women spent less time working in
formal jobs, instead taking care of the home.<a href="#fn30"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>The greatest limitation in Cuba is that of food. Due to the
dependency on the USSR paying above market rates for Cuban sugar
exports, its collapse hurt the economy of Cuba, leading to the Special
Period.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> Without money from the USSR, Cuba
was unable to buy food, and had to implement even more restrictive
rationing; rationing had been in effect in Cuba since 1961 but had
failed in alleviating the food issues.<a href="#fn32"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>
There is hope however for the future: in 2008 the government introduced
new land reform laws which allowed “farmers and cooperatives access to
idle land ... to increase production.”<a href="#fn33"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>If one measures Cuba by where it has come from, the Revolution has
seen many great successes: healthcare, education, equalizing of society,
and the spreading of revolutionary ideas. However, the limits of these
successes are visible and put strain on Cuba, such as the inequities of
income distribution and its racialized and gendered impacts, as well as
the limitations of housing reform due to corruption, and the food
allocation challenges following the collapse of the country’s largest
trading partner.</p>
