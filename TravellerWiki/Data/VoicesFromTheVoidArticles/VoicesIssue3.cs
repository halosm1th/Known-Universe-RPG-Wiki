The 73 year old man is divisive in any Federation allied territories, but most of all on his home-world of Kotlik(5,3:1'1). Born before the great war, Ford joined the fledgling Kotlik military in the days shortly after the dispersion of the jump drive. Private Ford worked his way up the ranks of the Kotlik army in a series of border skirmishes against both Stryker(83340|5,2:1'1) and later Jonancy(83343|2,3:1'1) which ended with Stryker becoming a client state of Kotlik and Ford earning the rank of Captain.",

The Major General would go on to lead the Erwinville Campaign.",
                            "The Erwinville Campaign gave rise to and then cemented the title of Blood General. Initially an insult mostly from privates due to the Generals often excessively high body count during siege battles, the title would take on a new meaning after the usage of two void bombs resulting in the destruction of the Dunlo(83365-2-8|5,1:1'2) and SpriggYoung(83365-3-17|6,1:1'2). The Imperial propaganda machine immediately began painting now General Ford as a mass murderer, in response the Kotlik Alliance distanced themselves from him, revealing that he had acted alone, using schematics that he had negotiated for behind the Alliances back, and which had been produced illegally by the Western Islands Alliance at the United Federation of Earths behest. On 6/5/83365 news of the destruction reached Kirksey(8,3:1'2), and on 14/6/83365 an armistice was agreed to and confirmation sent back to the Dominate and Kotlik governments by the Blood General from his Forward Operating Base on Kayenta(7,3:1'2).",
                            "When news of General Fords betrayal reached the public, he immediately became the center of the conversation. His supporters arguing what he did was necessary to end the war, as the Dominate had begun negotiations with the growing Western Islands Commune. While his detractors pointed out that his campaign was already showing great success and it was unlikely that the Dominate war machine could have held out in the North much longer, and the reason for surrender had more to do to with the Western Islands Alliance announcing an alliance with the Old Islands Defense League and strengthening ties with the various growing Trade Consortiums around the sector. Ultimately, in response to pressure from the United Federation of Earth the Kotlik Alliance agreed to let the Blood General retire.",
                            "This retirement was ended early following the Military coup in 83372 which resulted in the new Kotlik Military Junta assuming control over the alliances territories, composed mostly of the admirals of the various Alliance fleets. Realizing that they needed a way to calm and control ground forces, while asserting control over the territories that chose not to break off into Independent Baronies the Junta chose to bring the Blood General back due to his popularity among the common troops for ending the Dominate War.

                            "Today, the Blood General is one of the 7 Supreme Judges of the Kotlik Tribunal, overseeing all military cases with his focus' being super weapons, espionage, treason, and ground operations. Many citizens in the Tribunal have had their ability to speak revoked for fear of damaging moral, creating an image of solidarity with the Blood General, an image the United Federation of Earth and their various puppets (the Western Islands Alliance and Islands Defense Force, etc.) are all to happy to uphold"
