    <h1>Voices From The Void 1. Bryce Bracing for fallout from Blackmail. (10/04/83390EST)</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the <a href="VoicesFromTheVoid">Voices from the Void</a>, floating into your brainspace from somewhere beyond the stars. Covering all the whispers heard across the stars about all the important islanders.</p>
    <p>In this issue, we lay the foundation of the happenins within the <a href="Islands_Sector">Islands</a> today, 10/04/83390EST.</p>

    <h2>Kendrick: 1,1</h2>
    <p>The Kendrick sector is one of the hotbeds for action, the isolated Kotlink Tribunal share a border with the Dominate Supremius to the south, as well as the Western Islands Commune to the east. Their only border from the massive Dominate Supremius and their Imperial Overlords is a small number of United Baronies controlled world, who act as buffer states and mediate the peace. </p>
    <h3>Baronies and Tribunal simmering to war.</h3>
    <p>Starting in the <a href="Subsector_Kendrick">Kendrick Subsector</a>, the <a href="ub">United Baronies</a> has moved a strike fleet above the planet of Singer. This was done in response to escalating tensions from the <a href="kt">Kotlink Tribunal</a>, who recently have been caught collaborating with a group of saboteurs on the UB world of Garrisonville to disable the docking system on the highport above the primary world. </p>
    <p>The Garrisonville system is known within the sector for its high population, as well as the local Baron and his ruling councils near dictatorial control of planetary politics. Within the Subsectors Barrons alliance, this action has been seen as a deliberate attempt to remove a vital supply line and trade route for the subsector Barons.</p>
    <p>The tribunal holds steadfast that while they supported the saboteur's, they believed they were funding a group of repair technician's at Tribunal owned dockyards on the Garrisonville highport. At this time, Voices from the Void has been unable to find any documentation showing that the Tribunal does in fact own any dockyards at the highport</p>
    <p>In response to the fleet moving into the Singer system, the <a href="ds">Dominate Supremius</a> has moved a company of Imperial infantry into the Ventura system, they claim only for defensive purposes. Sources within the military base on Ventura confirm that the troops have been drilling for possible invasion scenarios, as well as fast relocations for rapid support of local defensive militias.</p>
    <h3>Kotlink Investments!</h3>
    <p>Grand-Judge Broder Browning, speaker for the Kotlink Tribunal announced investment plans into the United Baronies controlled world of Seco. This has puzzled many within the baronies, while Grand-Judge Browning reaffirms that the investments are to help produce a long term economic trade route that will benefit both the Federation backed Tribunal as well the Baronies. Grand-Judge Browning also anounced that the Tribunal had begun constructing a shipping combine on the world of Redhook.</p>

    <h2>Wynona: 1,2</h2>
    <p><a href="Subsector_Wynona">Wynona</a> is the heartland of the <a href="wic">Western Islands Commune</a>, with only five of the twenty two planets being controlled by someone other then the Commune, and almost all of them being in the sectors North-Western section.</p>
    <h3>Brill Brewing Blackmail.</h3>
    <p>Above the Kotlink Tribunal Controlled world of Delrey, a blockade has formed, not backed by one of the numerous enemies the Tribunal has within the Subsector. No the blockade is done by none other then the Tribunal themselves. It may come as no surprise that a military tribunal would lock their own people in. Especially in the wake to a large popular movement on Delrey that has been tied back to the Western Islands Commune itself. The movement began in response to a transport lockdown that has been instigated on the world of Kotlink controlled world of Brill. The lockdown was done in an attempt to prevent a damning piece of evidence in the growing case against the starport controlling Oligarchy, that was uncovered by the Commune.</p>
    <p>At this time, the Commune has responded saying "While we had no part in the events taking place on these worlds, we strongly encourage the people to unite together and seize the means of production from the capitalist military pigs that keep them divided and downtrodden. If they can push out the Bourgeoisie elite the Commune will gladly welcome them into their anarcho-collective." At the same time, the Tribunal has chosen to issue a statement as well, saying "The actions a few craized leaders who will be replaced, and even worse, the actions of a few craized members of the populace are no reason for such radical shifts from the norm." Many on the two worlds, and within Tribunal controlled space disagree, saying that the Tribunal is just scared of having the Commune on the doorstep.</p>
    <h3>Mob treachery on Hutto</h3>
    <p>Recently broken by the Kotlink Tribune, thanks to a series of informers on the Baronies controlled world of Hadlyme, a plot involving the Imperial Mob to shift control of the baronies controlled world to the Commune has come to light. In response to this, a vocal group on the Commune world of Ellby have begun to speak up, supposedly supported by the Tribunal, talking about possibly shifting from Commune rule to perhaps joining the Barrons if this was the kind of company the Commune keeps.</p>

    <h2>Olivehurst Subsector: 1,3</h2>
    <p>The <a href="Subsector_Olivehurst">Olivehurst Subsector</a> is a major part of the Acadie Super highway, the major network running from the once <a href="oild">Old Islands Defense League</a> controlled world of Acadie, to the western Islands Commune and the Dominate Supremius. The Olivehurst subsector acts as the major artery into the Commune from Acadie. </p>
    <h3>Kommune Kontroll Fleet</h3>
    <p>Within the Commune, some odd fleet movements seem to be happening, while the primary strike fleet of the Commune has remained in orbit above their capital of Gassaway, a strike fleet was broken off. The fleet has recently been detected holding out in at the Naval base in the WilliamsField System. The sectors Baronies Alliance has issued a strong statement declaring "If the Commune contiunes to move military vessles into attack range of our planets, we will be forced to re-evaluate our willingness to support trade with the Commune." The commune responded stating "We are free to move our vessles around for routine patrolling, maintenance, and training exercises, of which this trip to WilliamsField is all three. Further more we remind the baronies that their position within this subsector is not a certainty and there are those, who the commune do not associate with or support, who may like to see someone different in control of the Baronies worlds."</p>
    <p>This open threat has been seen in the greater sector international community as a bluff.</p>
    <p>Though many are unsure just how much of a bluff this is. The commune has recently re-invested in a sector-wide bank on Bodfish, who holds a large amount of debt over the <a href="op">Olitar Protectorate</a>, as well, a company of Deutchland Regulars were spotted training on Gassaway.</p>
    <p>As well, it would seem that on the Baronies controlled world of Hartland, a group with ties to the Imperial Mob have been intimiating the starport union, cutting the planet off from vital trade. This was done following a recent visit of the supposed Imperial Don Korleonius, head of the Korleonius family, along with his private security detail. The Korleonius family is rumoured to be the largest of the 3 families that dominate the Imperial Mob in the <a href="berlinnic">Berlinnic Galaxy</a>.</p>
    <p>In response to the Mobs actions, Chairman of the Commune Carlo Hunter has denied any association with the imperial mob, though remarks that these kind of attacks are no surprise. There has yet to be prove a direct connection between these actions and the commune, in part because of a well funded mob backed counter intel operation run out of the Baronies controlled world of Moko.</p>

    <h2>Payette Subsector: 1,4</h2>
    <p>The <a href="Subsector_Payette">Payette Subsector</a> is the eastern edge of Commune controlled land, bordering with the <a href="url">United Reverse Lords</a> backed <a href="rrr">Red Rock Republic</a>, as well as the <a href="germushia">Germushian</a> backed <a href="witc">Western Islands Trade Consortium</a>.</p>
    <h3>Fleet Games</h3>
    <p>The Western Islands Commune has been seen moving a blockade fleet into orbit of the Commune controlled world of Owlshead, this was done in Response to the Western Islands Trade Consortium scavenger fleet operating within Commune border space, illegally. The blockade fleet is said to be in Owlshead only for defensive purposes. At this time, the Consortium backed scavenger fleet is reported to be located in the Treverton System.</p>
    <h3>A Religious Wrinkle on Hinkle</h3>
    <p>In a cultlike, pentagram, candles, sacrifice, the whole parsec, ceremony preformed by the Elite Monks on Hinkle, a port to the Nether was opened for 7.3 seconds releasing a reported 3.4 million demonic beasts onto the planet. A transport locked-down has been issued a group of Witchers have been dispatched from RedRock to assist in cleanup.</p>
    <h3>Union busting or Union Buster?</h3>
    <p>In response to recent tough on Union action undertaken by President Len Farrel on the Corporate Union controlled world of Richey, riots have broken out. The company was cracked down on after it refused to assist in setting up a covert transport network on the world of Leupp in order to secure more trade for the republic. </p>
    <p>While the overall tone within the republic is one of support, the lack of trade since the Acadie super highway has caused a loss of jobs and a large economic downturn for the republic in recent months. Requiring witcher assistance in dealing with numerous political threats.</p>

    <h2>Oren Wastes 1: 2,1</h2>
    <p>The <a href="Subsector_Oren_Wastes_1">Oren Wastes 1</a> subsector is part of the fallout from the Oren Project, and specifically is the core of the Dominate Supremius, having a near complete iron grip on the sector.</p>
    <h3>Flabby Fleet</h3>
    <p>A group on the Dominate Capital of Kirksley have begun questioning why the Capital fleet that sits in orbit does nothing but gather dust. Questioning the Sovereignty of the Barronies Controlled planet of Quasqueton. The Dominate Supreme Dino Becker, currently returning from a political trip to the Commune in the Weskan sector, says "The Ambassador on Amondiage(Orlando Baldoa) is the SectMoff, that puts him in charge of all imperial military action in the sector. He says keep the fleet here, given it has several imperial star destroyers, and several key position within the fleet are controlled by imperial personnel, it would be best to maintain our current position.</p>

    <h2>Oren Wastes 2: 2,2</h2>
    <p>The <a href="Subsector_Oren_Wastes_2">Oren Wastes 2 Subsector</a> is the farthest south the Western Islands Commune goes. It is also home to the Vers backed <a href="gse"> Gunripped Stellar Empire</a>, as well as the <a href="axios_Alliance">Axois Allaince</a> backed <a href="tp">Tilova Packed</a>, and a few United Baronies planets.</p>
    <h3>Seductive Seditionists Silently Sneak</h3>
    <p>On the United Baronies controlled world of Thippe464, a seditionist movement seeking to join the Tilova Packed has begun picking up steam. After the Baronies heavy investment in the creating a <a href="polandskia">Polandskian</a> backed manufacturing district, the Gunripped Stellar Empire saw a chance to seduce the other Barons to their side.</p>
    <p>Sarah Helsguard, a prominent actress within the empire and close personal friend of Gunripped Empress Deidre Moon, has been seen talking to the head Baron on Hotania, Veltun Colas. Baron Colas has been admient that any action to distrupt his government, or the governments of any United Baronies worlds within the subsector would result in a world of pain for all factions, including possibly dragging the Western Islands Commune into the conflict if need be.</p>
    <p>In response to these threats, Empress Moon has activated a division of her armies personnel on Gunripped. Evoits, capital of the Tilova Pact, President Leta Cortez remarked that any military attack against any Pact world would be met with a brutal ground occupation. Thanking the hardend people of the Tilova Pact and talking about how the war that ended on Tilova has made the population better prepared then anyone else in the Subsector. </p>

    <h2>Oren Wastes 3: 2,3</h2>
    <p>The jam packed <a href="Subsector_Oren_Wastes_3">Oren Wastes 3 Subsector</a> contains several small factions, including the <a href="sca">Starcan Alliance</a>, the <a href="stc">Sar-Tan Confederacy</a>, the <a href="op">Olitar Protectorate</a>, <a href="mmr">Mainhair Military Republic</a>, and the <a href="vds">Venhut Dominate States</a>. This sector is vital to various trade routes for both major factions in the sector.</p>
    <h3>Stars, Sars, and Olitar</h3>
    <p>On the Starcan Alliance controlled world of Lokleen, the Deutschland backed Olitar Protectorate have been caught blackmailing a large local warlord into taking control over the starport and stealing any fuel that comes through the port, effectively taking control of the tiny populations primary source of power. Alliance Leader Bryce Green had this to say on the scandal "The Starcan Alliance was formed to protect all of its people, whatever the blackmail on the Warlord Alyom, the ALliance shall step in to rectify the issue. The population within the Alliance is well known for our ability to deal with foriegn invasions on our soil. As well, we are working with our own trade organizations to covertly transport fuel into the planet to allow the effected some repreive."</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the neighboring Star-Tan Confederacy President Gaylord Ramsey mentioned his peoples own resliance to war and invasion, and their strong importation inspection rules to prevent this sort of uprising from being allowed in the first place.</p>
    <p>From the Olitar Protectorate, Chief Orator Corrine Lowery refrained from commenting on their involvement during question period following the demonstration of new Landing craft technology for quick planetary invasions that was recently purchased with a loan from the Western Islands Commune.</p>

    <h3>Quitting Coda?</h3>
    <p>A number of craft from all the notable places in the sector have been seen arriving in the Coda system lately, of important note seemed to include the landing castle of the <a href="ro">Rex van der Ostrosvki</a> Nataniel Huber, who was seen to have <i>very</i> close ties to the Nystul-Hornet company, a large mining company officially headed by the Knights Brash and Boisterous son Tony Huber.</p>
    <p>Coda, who is officially controlled by the tight fisted technomaster Chistov Clinton, who is heavily backed with advanced Versian Technology by the Knight. It isn't just the Versians though, the Imperial Ambasador Orlando Baldoa was seen arriving in his signature First Order transport, along with representatives from the United Baronies, the Western Islands Commune and the Western Islands alliance. The topic on all the high profile visitors minds? Whether Coda should consider joining the Western Islands Trade Consortium.</p>
    <p>In response to what Mainhair Military Republic Consul Bradley Webn was seen calling the Senate to move an Infantry Army to the planet Uncode, and lobbiests with ties to the Imperial Mob are reported to be pushing to mobalize the Republics main strikefleet, which current sits in Mainhair.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the Dominate Minor Adeline Dediar, head of the Venhut Domiante States was reported to be mobalizing their own strike fleet, with the expressed purpose of protecting the recently sercured freigher contract with the <a href="oild">Old Islands Defense League</a> to control the Acadie Highway throughout the sector. This trade deal was "sealed" with a kiss and a trading of fluids when reports surfaced that a major part of Venhut signing the agreement was because of an Imperial Mob seductress working with the Dominate Minor.</p>

    <h2>Oren Wastes 4: 2,4</h2>
    <p>Compared to the Oren Wastes 3, the <a href="Subsector_Oren_wastes_4">Oren Wastes 4</a> is a much more calm Subsector. Being mainly a Western Islands Trade Consortium stronghold, but it also importantly contains the world of Tonganoxie, the "capital" of the United Baronies.</p>
    <h3>Humering Hume.</h3>
    <p>Alligations of a Western Islands Trade Consortium covert shipping operation operating out of the recently joined Contsortium world of Hume. The United Barones are reported to be responsibile for large scale civil unrest and a growing anti-Constorium popular movement. Chelsea Huff, Host-Baroness of the United Baronies, from Tonganoxie said "We operate no such movement on any planet outside of our lands. We simply respect the rights of the free barons to control their land within the Suki Corridor as was promised to us following the great war. The furthest my own barony goes to operate in this sector is having a number of marketers operating on Tonganoxie. This can hardly be called a crime given the Constortiums current <i>illegial</i> blockade of Trevor."</p>
    <p>The blockade of Trevor comes following a recent troop movement, where a group of elite skirmisheres were seen arriving on the planet of Blissfield, a sure stopping point before heading to Hume, and possibly even further.</p>
    <p>With escelating tensions in the Subsector, a transport lockdown was also put in place on the planet of Coolin.</p>

    <h2>Doland: 3,1</h2>
    <p>The <a href="Subsector_Doland">Doland Subsector</a> is home to a small chunk of the Dominate Supremius, and is the captial subsector for the <a href="wia">Western Islands Alliance.</a></p>
    <h3>Dangerous Doland</h3>
    <p>The United Baronies controlled planet of Bronaugh was changed recently when the starport was formally aquired by the Domiante Supremius, giving them a monopoly on trade for the small United Baronies outcropping in the Subsector leaving the Western Islands Alliance exposed and alone.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the Dominate was seen finishing the construction of a new Medical Center on Tokeland, and are protecting it with a group of SPARTANs, as well as moving a number of imperials into the Baronies controlled planet of Covinia. </p>
    <p>The Alliance, in response to these moves have started working to smuggle resources for various resistance groups into the Dominate, as well as smuggling out those who want to leave the opressive grip of the Dominate.</p>
    <p>But scout service members have reported a group of Commune backed mercenarines operating on the Federation world of Lapaz, working with the local democractic movement to oust the current religous ruling party.</p>
    <p>Though because of cracked comms on the New colchis Buisness Board, the United Baronies discovered that the mercenarines had actually, shocking to only those without a brain, been sent to install a communist government! This response has prompted the Dominate to move a group of Sith onto the currently neutral world of Dagget, working with the <a href="e">Esperenza Planetary Government.</a></p>
    <p>In response to the mercenarines, the Alliance has been seen taking many dramatic actions, the capital fleet (including a federation Battle-Cruiser) has been set to Battle-Alert. A Federation army on Browerville has also been set to mobalize. Meanwhile space marine companies on Quanah have begun preparing to move north, and grav-tank formations on Kingstree have receved orders to head to Delray. The Alliance transit web operating out of Timpson has reported 80-85% processing usage, and the covert shipping facilities on Chatfield have closed their doors to private contracts, citing lack of resources. Meanwhile the Research and Development labs on Mabscott have been kicked into high gear, with large blocks of funding begin allocated to them.</p>

    <h2>New Islands: 3,2</h2>
    <p>The <a href="Subsector_New_Islands">New Islands Subsector</a> is a major subsector within the Islands, it is the location for the <a href="ncbb">New Colchis Buisness Board</a>, the <a href="idf">Independent Defense Federation</a>, and the Esperenza Planetary Government.</p>
    <h3>Defensive Federation Defenses.</h3>
    <p>The Defense Federation was recently seen passing another M5.3Cr bill to upgrade their asteroid defense network, including purchasing the support of a UFE army.</p>
    <h3>Esperenza Stores Gold.</h3>
    <p>The Esperenza Planetary Government has recently started making it big, acting as one of the sectors largest banks, and easily the one with the most security and safety, as well as offering a covert shipping option for those looking to bank with privacy. Esperenza has positioned themselves to become an econmic powerhouse by simply being the private bank of the economy.</p>
    <h3>New Colchis' New Combine</h3>
    <p>The New Colchis Buisness Board was recently lobbied by the Germushian Governemnt into funding the creation of a new Shipping combine to service the new and old Isladns sectors, allowing the Buisness Board to offically become a part of the Federation Trade Network, a great win for the growing nation.</p>

    <h2>Old Islands: 3,3</h2>
    <p>The <a href="Subsector_Old_Islands">Old Islands Subsector</a> contains the <a href="nta">Neubayern-Topas Alliance</a>, the Old Islands Defense league, as well as a couple of planets controlled by the Independent Defense Federation.</p>
    <h3>Moles creating Mountains</h3>
    <p>An NTA mole told an IDF informant about the purchasing of technology that would allow the NTA troop transport ships the ability to cross up to 4 parsecs of space. In respones to this alarming procurement, the IDf has relocated their first offensive army to Sansterre.</p>
    <h3>New Marktes for Neubayern</h3>
    <p>The NTa recently issued a press release talking about their plan to open new markets on the OILD controlled world of New Home, saying that this trade deal will benefit both of them greatly. The results of this are yet to be seen, but it is a good political show of unity.</p>
    <h3>Acadie is dead. Long Live Acadie!</h3>
    <p>Acadie, the heart and soul of the empire within the western islands. Economic powerhouse for the Amondiage Imperial Government, and allowed the empire so much control over the Old Islands Defense League. Has once again voilently changed hands, following the bloody assassination of Governor Ceasarius by an imperial actor, Antonius Skyteth, the planet was plunged into a state of civil war. During which the government was overthrown for a worker sympathetic (and initally suspected to be Detuschland backed) communist revolution. But to everyones shock, the planet recently transfered into the hands of the United Barones, under the command of a Governor Marco Haydrich.</p>
    <p>The new Governor was suspected to be assiated by the known islands terrorist Menty. Famed for making his wealth on various art crimes, including stealing the great Gohn's plays, and resulting in the horrific car bombing nearly killing a police officer who got to close, resulting in the man fleeing into the islands. Today it is known that there is a large Menty supporting group within the Old Islands, and it is suspected to have assisted with the government overthrow.</p>
    <p>When asked, Imperial lawyers on Amondaige said that a deal had been negotiated wherein the Old Islands Defense League, in assocication with the Imperial Tillium Company, have exclise rights to export and sale of Tillium from the world. ImpTilCo has also stated that they are constructing a "Class A highport for exclusive imperial use." in orbit above the Baronies World. In an offical response from the Barons office, Acadie has agreed to these terms.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, faimed ex-Witcher and Master-Sith Alon Ze Great has recoved sucessfully on Amondaige from a series of blaster wounds inflicted by what are now believed to be the same group responsible for taking the previous Governor of Acadies life. Master-Sith Alon himself called for the grav-tank divisions on Amondaige to be activated, and has called for his fellow Sith on Amondaige to go with him aboard the OILD strikefleet in orbit above Amondiage, and to retake Acadie from the "Abyssal beasts who bested me, Ze Great!"</p>

    <h2>Stacyville: 3,4</h2>
    <p>The <a href="Subsector_Stacyville">Stacyville Subsector</a> is home to the Western Islands Trade Consotrtium, the <a href="cma">Coila Military Allaince</a> and the <a href="jktp">Jeffers-Kosse Trade Pact</a>.</p>
    <h3>Consortium Grows</h3>
    <p>Chairman Kirkhoven of the Western Islands Trade Consotrtium announced today that he had created a number of new freightor contracts on Kirkhoven for the Trade constoritum as well has invested a large amount of Venture Capital into the growing planet of Gurnee.</p>
    <h3>Trade Pact Strengthening</h3>
    <p>The Jeffers-Kosse Trade Pact was strengthed recently when Spokeswoman Ella Glass announced a shared investment with Xiao-Ming into a research facility on Jeffers, as well as a large injection of venture capital into the world of Wilsonburg.</p>
    <h3>Trade Pact Worried</h3>
    <p>The Trade pact isn't only in the news because of their investments. They recently leaked that the Coila Military Alliaince had hired Mercenaries and stationed them on Escalanta. This has prompted the JKTP to deploy their own secturiy personel on Kosee. In response General Robin Krause deployed his infantry army to defened himself on Coila.</p>

    <h2>Intercourse: 4,1</h2>
    <p>The <a href="Subsector_Intercourse">Intercourse Subsector</a> is scattered, with the <a href="ek"> Essia Kritarchy </a>, the <a href="ss">Spritwood Senate</a>, the <a href="istc">Intercourse Subsector Trade Consotrtium</a>, and the <a href="iwtp">Ioni-Waskish Trade Pact</a>.</p>
    <h3>Essia lawyers after runners.</h3>
    <p>Hot on the tail of the Spiritwood Senate announcing their new fleet of blockade runners being commissioned above Spiritwood, Essia Kritarchy lawyers were quick to point out the joint agreement between Intercourse Subsector nations to respect legally created blockades. Stating that by purchasing blockade runners, the Senate was clearly moving to circumvent any possible blockades imposed in the future. The Spiritwood Senate reaffirmed their commitment to the treaty, saying that the new ships were creating for dealing with Dominate Supremius blockades around Western Islands Alliance systems, which the Sentate relies on for the importation of vital resources.</p>

    <h2>Citra: 4,2</h2>
    <h3>Citra Subsector Trade Consortium announces new economic plan.</h3>
    <p>The Citra Subsector Trade Consortium announced their economic plan for the upcoming decade. Important points include talks of increasing trade through the creation of a commodity broker firm on Sargents, as well as funding the creation of a series of Covert Shipping Facilities on Lightfoot. As well, a large investment was announced in research, including the creation of a new Research and Development firm on Chaska.</p>
    <h3>Citra Cold trade War.</h3>
    <p>Doswell, controlled by the Ionia-Waskish Trade pact, serves as a hub for the Trade Pacts informant network. This is because it is a major through point for the trade Consortiums operating in the south western Islands. So when reports started flowing about a blockade fleet leaving the trade Consortium controlled planet of Charenton, its destination of the Pact controlled system of Sumas, they were to be believed. Now, several months later, it was clear that the intelligence checked out. The trade pact, initally panned by critics for seeming to agressive, the movement of elite troops to defend Ionia is now widely praised. The recently established shipping combine is also receiving praise for being able to deliver supplies to the blockaded system. Meanwhile a growing demagogue on Waskish have been calling for the expelitation of all Trade Consotrtium citizens and their supporters and allies, has picked up large amounts of steam in the wake of the largest peace time terorrist attack in trade pact history, the bombing of the Waskish highport by a pre-rerupted jump drive, nearly destroying the entire planet. The attack was only stopped by the quick response of Xiao-Ming backed corporate craft who selflessly lost their lives destroying both ships before series damage could be caused to Waskish.</p>

    <h2>Wallwern: 4,3</h2>
    <p><a href="Subsector_Wallwern">Wallwern</a> is a fairly unremarkable subsector. It contains some Rex van der Ostrosvki territories, the  Harwichport-Simla-Parcol Trade Pact, and a few United Baronies systems.</p>
    <h3>Barons Sight Scavengers</h3>
    <p>The Panoptic Matrix on the United Baronies controlled world of Worland spotted a Rex Ostrosvki backed scavenger fleet operating on Gattman, visiting the border regions with the Barons taking from pirated remains. This has caused the local Baron of Lattimore to request a strikefleet be sent, and now said fleet has standing patrol orders for border regions, with kill orders if it spots any Rex Ostrosvki scavenger ships.</p>
    <h3>Kings expand their realm.</h3>
    <p>The Kings of the Islands, or Rex van der Ostrosvki if you're a Versian, have recently made waves within the Wallwern subsector for expanding the sectors military power. Following the distastous attack on Glasgo station, a strikefleet has been dispatched to maintain control over the vital starship repair yards. The Kings also announced a new smuggling operation working out of the planet of Pawpaw, with the goal of destablizing the Baronies control over Tenstrike, as well as reinforcing the Kings controlled system of Hazelhurst with better planetary defenses.</p>

    <h3>Monopoly on Simla</h3>
    <p>The Harwichport-Parcol trade pact has recently been renamed to the Harwichport-Simla-Parcol Trade Pact, following the establishment of a Xiao-Ming monopoloy after funding the creation of a new Highport. This new addition formally brings the once subservient system into their own as a player in the system-level stage, possibily even usurping Parcol as the priority trade partner within the pact.</p>

    <h2>Zalenski: 4,4</h2>
    <p>The <a href="Subsector_Zaleski">Zalenski Subsector</a> is home to the Rex van der Ostrosvki.</p>
    <h3>Hostile Takeover to secure the home front.</h3>
    <p>The final light of freedom in the Zalenski is faiding as the Rex Ostrosvki have used their venture capital firm on Whigham to begin a hostile takeover of the only remaining Untied Baronies planet in the Subsector, Marchland. The planet has sent out a call to any "heros, despots, mad men, or terrorists" to help the small system to defend themselves from the Kings. A blockade fleet has begun forming above Cadyville, many suspect with the intention of taking control of Marchland and preventing those "heros" from landing at all.</p>
