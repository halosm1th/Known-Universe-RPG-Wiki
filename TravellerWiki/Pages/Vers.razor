    <h1>Vers Empire</h1>
    <p>The Vers Empire is one of the oldest nations in the known universe, beaten only by the <a href="uar">United Augmented Republic</a>, and tied with <a href="ufe">United Federation of Earth</a> given that both were founded at the same time. Since its foundational days, the Empire has been the opposition to the United Federation of Earth.</p>
    <p>
        From the cultural perspective, the Vers Empire is divided into 5 broad classes, which are
        <ol>
            <li>Aristocractic - Emperor, Lords, Knight-Commanders, Knights</li>
            <li>Militorius - Military personnel, but to knights</li>
            <li>Civis - Vers Citizen</li>
            <li>Versarian - Someone who's empire is of Versian decent, with the exceptions of <a href="xiaoming">Xiao-Ming</a> and the <a href="axiosAlliance">Axios Alliance</a></li>
            <li>Videntium - viewer(literal), foreigner, outsider</li>
        </ol>

        Technically, Versarian and Videntium are on the same level, as are Civis and Militorius, but in practice the honour of defending your lords land, and serving under your knight come before anything else. Versians of the Civis and Militorius class tend to be very honour bound, while those who are of the Aristocractic class, but not necessarily the ruling heir, tend to act with little regard to their families honour, preferring instead to flaunt it in place of their opulent wealth.

        <h2>Short Description</h2>
        <p>As ancient as the feudal system that inspires it, the Vers Empire is a nation founded on honour, service to the greater good, and ultimately the idea that a person is only as worthy as the work they preform, and their word. Now in practice there is a high degree of nepotism in the decaying once great empire. Fallen from the great hights of over 4000 lords in the Colossius, down to controlling not even half of one galaxy, nearly broke and once again on the edge of a civil war. The leader, Empress Camilla Vers Allussya only holding the throne by sheer political skill, her opposition, John Hellsbeck controlling the Citadel until he has the power to overthrow the empress and take control of the empire.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Vers Empire is one of the oldest nations still in existence in the Known Universe Today. It is responsible for spawning more nations then anyone else, and their impact on Universal history shall never be forgotten, so long as a human is still alive.</p>
        <h3>The First Age: The pre-founding</h3>
        <p>The Vers Empire was born out of a rebellion to the Augmentation crisis overtaking the western world. Russia, China and their allies in South east asia, Eastern Europe, and the middle east enforced their own brand of augmentation by flagrantly declaring it unhuman an immoral. Instead, what would become the Vers empire preached their own "altered" human, first with the Piety of the church, creating rampaging demonic beasts who had tapped into powers from the <a href="nether">Nether</a> or the <a href="abyss">Abyss</a>, while their higher priests were able to reach into the <a href="void">Void</a>. This obsession with religion over technology was mostly in the western Vers empire, the European front & the middle east. While the Eastern side of what would become the Vers empire battled the United Augmented in Japan, India, and Oceanian (especially besieging the <a href="uar">United Augmented Republic</a> capital of Australia)</p>
        <p>Following the augment war, the Holy warriors of the Orthodox Union pushed further into Europe. Famous reports of the first deployment of the grayknights protecting against the seige of a Polish town. The townsfolk held their own for nine days against the Russian army. A group of NATO backed gray knights pushed into the town. In response Russia unleashed one of their Porozhdeniye ada, whos demonic rampage set the town ablaze. Ending in a show down with five Gray Knights against the three headed hoof footed beast in the ruins of a church. The gray knights wielding the earliest known voidblades murdered the creature, the first time it had ever been done by NATO.</p>
        <p>This destructive encounter forced Vers to reevaluate their plan to conquer the world. Instead switching to a defense war and choosing to conquer a different world, the now declared Dominate Rex Victor Petrov constructed a fleet of spaceships in Russia, and funded the covert construction of vessels within their allied regions that would soon make up the Vers empire. On the 23rd of August 2106, at 09:32am <a href="earthStandardTime">EST</a> the planet of earth lost just over half of its remaining 6 billion people as the ground shook around the globe. At the same time as the third largest space battle in then-human history taking place over south america, the fleet of 36 Lenin-Class Vessels Departed from Earth, while hundreds of others followed in the massive ships wake. In total 473 ships would launch from Earth within 2 hours of the first launch.</p>
        <h3>The Second Age: The Dominate</h3>
        <p>Upon the second Great Voyage (The first is the <a href="url">United Reverse Lords</a> leaving Earth.) from the founding home of humanity, Earth, another great empire began to crawl towards their new home. During the six month journey to the red planet, the various nations that would make up the Vers empire relied on Dominate Victor Petrov's capital ship, named in the newly created Versian Language: "Universalis Victorius". Petrov declared himself Tzar, and the people who controlled his gifts of Lenin-Class ships swore fealty to him, and declared him their king. The 3.72 billion people aboard their fleet of ships were educated on their new government, taught its new language. The cultural of Vers was one of need. Everyone worked together to keep each other alive, because even one mistake could doom everyone. The honour of your job to keep others alive seeped deeply into society. Those at the top, commanding the massive vessles and the people working for them were seen as the divine savours, keeping the layman alive.</p>
        <p>Fealty would come with three requirements central to Versian Philosophy. The first, in return to absolute rule over their land, the Lord would be bound by the laws of the Tzar, thought lords together could voice their discontent freely, and if more then half of them agreed, they could strike down a law. The second, the lords must maintain an army, for Vers is a nation born into war, and defending their land was an absolute requirement, and if the Emperor called upon you to help in the war, you must. Third, each lord was required to maintain a landing castle, within which they could store their army and transport the army to their rightful claims on Earth. The landing castle would become the foundational symbol of Versian military power. As well, the Tzar declared that while the lord did not have to fight in battle themselves, the Lord must then appoint a Knight to take their castle to Earth and conquer in the name of the Tzar and Vers.</p>
        <p>By the arrival at Vers(Mars) the 36 'Lords' of Vers had been founded. Each given a large plot on the small red world, the Oath taken by all of them to one day return to Earth and Conquer it. Not safe themselves, their cameras could see the Federation building up their defenses. During what would become the First Official battle of the Sol war (vs the third world war), a federation Cruiser backed by two corvettes engaged a rearmed Lenin-Class transport ship named the Axios. While the Impressive warship from Vers held its ground against the corvettes, it took serious damage and was unable to move from its position, stuck in orbit around the sun. The Vers Empire chose to roll with the punches and turned the trapped ship into a space station. This station would become Axion Station, where the <a href="axionAlliance">Axion Accords</a> would be signed.</p>
        <p>It was also during this time that Vers empire would begin to mine Aldminium, a rare crystal found under Vers' surface which could hold Void Energy if a priest could place it in there. The crystal was soon discovered to be able to put into bladed weapons to act as a conduit to active the power from the crystal. Scientists soon discovered they could harness this energy for direct weapons, and began crafting powerful energy-lances using the Aldminium crystals.</p>
        <h4>Found of the Equites Ordinis deorum</h4>
        <p>Within Lord Troyard's segmentum of Vers, the Church was particularly powerful. To the point where the Knight in charge of Troyards castle was also a priest for the church, who had the ability to draw upon the power of the void. The priest soon realized many of his soldiers held this same power, and so the Equites Ordinis deorum (Knights of the Gods) was founded. Taking instead the Aldminium Orange instead of the normal Martian Red armour. As well, members of the order, may choose to dawn a purple cape with gold trim, instead of the normal golden cape with silver trim. Those not actively serving the order but who are members may wear their cape with their normal Versian Red armour, but are forbidden from wearing the Aldminium Orange armour when not directly serving the order. A tradition that has held up into the current, 10th Age.</p>
        <p>The order itself was more focused on gaining a deeper understanding of the void in all aspects. While the knights themselves must craft their own voidblade with a piece of Aldminium they mine themselves, instead of being given a simple one. The Knights then train in how to harness the power of the void, using it to create and destroy objects, push and pull objects, raise and lower them, alter their properties. The Knights persue their own education, taking on masters to teach them. Once you are in the order you are free to come and go as you please, though to join you must dedicate 5 years to your entry tests and training if you get in. Your training is yours to complete. Those currently in service of the Order now serve the Empress directly, while in time past they served whichever lord housed the order. The Order also took in a majority of the priests from the Vers empire, dedicating their time to studying and research. Even within the modern Versian Empire, the major religion is deorism, descendent from the Order itself.</p>

        <h4>The Sol War (Siege of Earth)</h4>
        <p>The first two years of the Sol war, from the Vers Empires prospective, were fairly uneventful. After the Axios' being crippled, Most of the remaining two years involved only a few naval battles, and two battles involving infantry.</p>
        <p>The first infantry engagement was on Axion Station, when a UFE destroyer group broke through Versian defenses and dropped off three platoons of infantry. While the Federation troops were eventually pushed out of the station, it wasn't without heavy causalities. This event led to two major realizations for Vers. First, that more armour was needed for their infantry, as takes were out. and Second that the battle was only decided by who had more bodies and who shot first.</p>
        <p>The second infantry engagement took place in the asteroid belt past Vers. While the Vers Empire had initally worked to colonize the belt, the "steel barons" and the people under them seemed to believe they were more closely related to an alliance, then a direct member of the empire. The Barons held control over the vital resources needed to construct the Versian fleets, and cities. Knowing this, the UFE chose to attack the Refinery station of Ceres, the seige of Ceres would last most of the second year, and with the bloody conclusion serving to push the UFE fleet back to Earth, gave the Versian lords the fleeting feeling of freedom to press their advantage.</p>
        <p>This would culminate when the 36 Versian lords directed their Knights to take the landing castles out towards Earth. Six specific knights had been chosen to launch an invasion of Luna. The moon housed the United Federation of Earths 'Moonmac' project. Covering the surface of the moon with Magnetic Acceleration Cannons, capable of ripping a landing castle apart in at most five hits. Luna was home to 14 different 16 cannon platforms. As well as controlling the Earth orbital grid consisting of another 42 cannons. This impressive defense grid would make it nearly impossible for the Versian fleet to land on Earth, regardless of whether the Federation fleet could deal with them or not.</p>
        <p>The 36 Landing castles would be backed by the steel barons offensive fleet, consisting of another two dozen ships, mostly destroyers and corvettes with three crusiers thrown in as well. There was also the Dominate fleet from the Tzar himself, consisting of another 47 ships, most of which were repurposed Lenin-class transports, or other ships prepared from the great journey reformed to serve the military. This brought the Versian fleet to a total of 107 ships.</p>

        <h4>The Siege of Earth</h4>
        <p>After Launching from Axios station, the 36 landing castles departed on their 62 day journey to Earth. On the 27rd day of their crusade, the fleet encountered the Solar Auxiliary Force, who the federation had dispatched to slow down the Vers Empire in an attempt to buy more time for their main fleets repairs. The SAF was wiped out quickly by the impressive new landing castles, who had previously struggled in the confines of the Asteroid Belt Battles. The small 13 ship fleet was quickly crushed with only 17 Versian causalities, all in their fighter wings. This early victory would not be the last in the siege. </p>
        <p>At day 28 the Mac array began firing, the rounds would arrive on day 33, three days before the Luna bound ships were to break off. The damage from the initial volley would leave 19 ships destroyed, and another 13 damaged, including 4 landing castles bound for Earth. While none of the core ships were destroyed, this loss would ultimately be a sign of what was to come to the siege.</p>
        <p>On day 37, the Luna ships break off, at the same time, the Federation Flagship, Deucalion led the First Federation on a suicide mission to stop the invading army. Mac rounds from Luna and Earth continued to decimate the fleet, destroying another 15 ships before the fleet arrived. Day 49 the Federation fleet arrived and began a battle with the Versian fleet, slowing them down for three days, destroying 34 of the remaining 67 ships before being forced to retreat back to Earth for repairs. The Deucalion chose to break off from the Federation Fleet and instead head towards Luna. </p>
        <p>Of the 33 remaining ships, 14 were landing castles. The empire itself knew that it would only need about 10 to land on Earth actually conquer it, and if they could get at least 8 they could conceivably defend themselves well enough to buy enough time for Reinforcements to arrive. This became the sole mission of the remaining castles. Land enough of them to hold the planets. The fleet began willfully wasting resources to deal with the never ending barrage of mac rounds, just to insure the survival of the landing castles. On board the Versian Ship 'Moskow', Sigmar would be field promoted to Commander, and eventually captain during the Siege due to the death of his superior officers. With the destruction of the landing castle he served under, he would wind up being the highest ranked member of his Lords military and would thus earn the Title of Versian Knight of Germushia.</p>
        <p>Day 59 saw the return of the Deucalion along with what was left of the Federation fleet, now merged with what was left of the Solar Auxiliary Force, the 25 ships faced down their 33 Versian enemies. They slowed the Versian fleet for another two days, and destroyed two landing castles, along with five other ships. The Federation fleet itself lost another 19 ships before retreating with their heavily wounded fleet.</p>
        <p>With 12 landing castles and 14 other ships, the Versian fleet continued its journey, now a total of five days behind, the Siege of Luna had turned into a bloody corridor war according to the comms reports. Everyone was shocked at how much of a fight the federation was putting up, as well as marvelling at the speed with which they were repairing their ships and launching new ones. During a data-Raid on Luna, it was uncovered that the federation was launching nearly empty hulls running with less then skeleton crews, at bare minimum usability, absolutely wrecking their economy and resource stockpiles.</p>
        <p>On day 68, the Versian fleet arrived in Orbit around Earth, now consiting of 11 landing castles and 9 support ships. The pitiful federation fleet chose to hide in the planets atmosphere, attacking the landing castles during their weakest moment, landing. The fleet was able to destroy all but 6 landing castles, leaving Vers just two short of enough to hold their own. Meanwhile the MAC grid in orbit destroyed another 6 ships from the Versian fleet before retreating.</p>
        <p>On Earth, the six castles landed at: 1) Moskow, Russia. 2) Washington Dc, 3) Paris, France. 4) Beijing, China, and 5) Kinshasa, Congo. Lacking any control of South America or Oceanian would ultimately serve the failure of the Landing knights. But the castles would put up a valient defense, fighting for nearly three months straight, taking most of Africa and Europe, most of Russia, a large chunk of China, but failing to make much progress in North America, where the capital is located.</p>
        <h4>The Siege of Luna</h4>
        <p>On day 37 of the journey to Earth, six landing castles broke off alone from the main crusading fleet, their destination was the home of the  MAC cannon array that had been slaughtering their allies for days now. The Six castles had been specifically chosen, their Knights trained with the sole intention of taking Luna. The specific orders were: Luna Wolves, Luna Guides, Lua Wreckers, Yueliang Quzhujuan,  warathat alqamar, Reges Luna.</p>
        <p>During the journey to Luna, several barrages of MAC rounds crossed the path of the castles, two of which were destroyed (the Lua Wreckers [day 42] and the Warathat Alqamar [day 48]). The remaining four castles continued on. It was known to Versian command that really only two intact castles would need to make it to the Moon for the celestial body to fall. Unfortunately for the landing castles, the UFE Flagship, Deucalion, equipped with the first Void Drive came to assault the Luna fleet, alone. On day 53, the Deucalion would void jump from the battle with the Primary Versian Fleet, and instead come into battle with the remaining four landing castles in the Luna group taking one of the landing castles by complete surprise destroying it before it even had time to detected the vessel.(Reges Luna)</p>
        <p>For three days the splinter fleet would engage the flag ship, while being peppered with MAC rounds from the Moon. The combined fire power would destroy another landing castle (Yueliang Quzhujuan [Day 55]), leaving the other two crippled, with more MAC rounds inbound. The Moon was assumed to be a sure victory.</p>
        <p>Day 69 would mark the return of the Deucalion to the battle against the primary Versian fleet. Around the Moon, the two ruined landing castles of the Luna Wolves and the Luna Guides crawled along, appearing closer to debris than an actual fighting force. Upon crashing down on the desolate surface, the two castles reformed in the Luna Wolves ruins, due to their superior numbers.</p>
        <p>The Surface of the moon became the bloody battleground of the bloodiest battle of the war, the two month battle would start with dense trench warfare on the surface of the Moon, as the early federation troops were quickly slaughtered by the Exo-Skeleton, Void energy based weapons of the Vers Army. Soon after the fighting turned to close quatres slaughter, with voidblades being wielded by those in power armour commanding their armoured Versian warriors through the tight corridors, overpowering the UFE troops.</p>
        <p>On day 73 the Luna Wolves seized control of the MAC control grid, allowing the Versian troops to defend their siege of the Moon.</p>
        <p>During the Siege of the Tycho on Day 105, the southern crater where the major UFE armoury on the Moon was located. The Luna Guides took heavy casualties but ultimately removed the Federation troops access ammo. Upon the remaining troops return to the Landing castle, the two Knights in command of their troops begin to disagree on the direction to take. The head of the Luna Wolves, Marius Lazaerek, declared that he was in command of the remaining troops and that they should asked the Federation to give them control over Luna, as a separate nation from Vers, arguing that so many lives had been lost, and this would actually give Vers a lot more power in the long run. The Knight for the Luna Guides, Pedro Kyras, argued that they should press their advantage, take the moon for Vers, and request reinforcements. While the two would technically continue to work together to try and secure Luna, the factions began to fight among themselves. The Luna Guides especially were torn. Many, while loyal to Vers, were tired from war and death. The idea of Luna as their home to defend, somewhere they could bring their families was pleasing.</p>
        <p>On day 139, Captain Plaritus Stotalius from the Luna Guides declared himself and his men to no longer be loyal to their old house, but instead joining the Luna Wolves. This declatation, and the resulting desertion from many other Luna Guide units led to a small battle between the two factions. Those loyal to the Guides quickly took hold of the armoury and MAC control room, while the Wolves controlled most other areas. The broken federation forces would commit to their last offensive at this time, launching an all out attack on the armoury. Which the Wolves used to buy them time to launch an all out attack on the MAC Control Room. While the federation troops failed to retake the armoury, the loss of the MAC control room was enough to convince the Guides to finally lay down their arms.</p>
        <p>On Day 156, Knight Marius Lazaerek would send a message to the Federation Commander of what was left of the Luna defense. The Message was simple, give the <a href="lunaKnights">Luna Knights</a> control of the moon, and they would break free from Vers, and act as the protectors of the Earth. Though, to appease Vers, they would not protect whoever was in control of the planet. Only that the planet itself would never be destroyed.</p>
        <p>On day 158, the United Federation of Earth send back a response. The Commander was to stand his troops down. The Moon was to be formally given to the newly Created Luna Knights. In response to their betrayal, Tzar Viktor Petrov declared the Luna knights traitors, and that any Versian who goes to Luna will be a traitor as well.</p>
        <h4>Axios Accords & Disappearance of Tzar Petrov</h4>
        <p>With the absolute decimation of the Versian fleet, Tzar Petrov was forced to attend to peace negotiation aboard the Axion Station, the once proud naval capital of his fleet. At the negotiations, it was decided that the Axion Station would serve as a neutral meeting point, technically controlled by the newly created Luna Knights, who would be one of the Signatories to the Axion Accords, along with the Gray Knights (who had taken control of Titan around Jupiter) and the witchers, who had discovered an ancient <a rhef="forerunners">Forerunner</a> technology stash on Mercury, and established a temple there.</p>
        <p>As well, it was decided that Vers shall be forbidden from raising a fleet of more then 100 ships, and shall prefer to rely on the Federation for protection. Meanwhile, stiff penalties were placed on the Versian Government, demanding trillions of dollars in repayment that the government simply couldn't do.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, as though a further mockery of the Tzars power. His newest flag ship, the Stalin-Class landing castle, was finished. Equipped with the first Versian Void drive. After signing the Axion Accords, the Tzar boarded his landing castle along with most of his troops and a fair number of citizens, before blinking away, never to be seen again. Many suspect the void drive was sabotaged by Alexi Volkov.</p>
        <h3>The Third Age: The First Empire</h3>
        <p>
            The title of Tzar had no established succession rules and the Tzar had named no true successor. There soon broke out a four way split between Canidates.
            <ol>
                <li>Wei-Jiang Pang - Lady of Chipan, an amalgamation of mostly Chinese with some other Asian groups, with strong support in the belt, and a fairly strong claim to the throne.</li>
                <li>Ebrahim Khamenei - Lord of the Midarius League, with close tiles to the Steel Barons, strong support within the government.</li>
                <li>Sergei Petrov - Viktors son, the heir to his lands, including the Imperial Capital.</li>
                <li>Sigmar - Now Lord of Germushia, as well as becoming beloved by the Church on Vers, drawing strong supoprt from the Religious wings. As well, his story of coming up from being a nobody teenager aboard one of the first vessels made him popular among the Belters.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Alexi, while a weaker lord in Vers, was very power hungry. He had been a close friend to Petrov and a rather important member of his government, helping to even draft the Accords in a way that wouldn't leave Vers too hurt. This work also gave Volkov a closer relationship with the United Federation of Earth. Using that relationship, Volkov argued that the Federation should crown him Emperor of Mars, bringing a swift end to the question of who should be Tzar. Earth was less then happy to do this. The people on Earth were tired of war, and the leaders feared backing this extremist unsupported leader (though he was actually fifth in line to the throne) would result in another civil war.</p>
        <p>Alxei would get his way though. After the Steel Barons in the belt began to grow restless with the lack of leader, the Lords on Vers demanded a new Tzar be found, or calling upon the Federation to deal with the rebels. The Federation chose to instead appoint Alexi Volkov to Emperor of Vers. This announcement came in the rather extreme approach given in the following exert:</p>
        <p style='font-size: small;'>"Pushing open the doors to the lords conciliary room, Alexi marched in, Aldminium Orange armour, six Versian knights donning the same coloured armour flanked him on his right. On Volkovs left, three Gray Knights, two witchers, and a Jed-i accompany him. Streaking across the Martian Marble floor. Heading straight past the normal seat for his Lordship Volkov, instead walking to the far end of the large, red chamber draped with the colours for each of the Versian Families, and planting himself firmly on the Tzars throne. Raising his hand to scilence the room, he announces to the crowed of angered lords 'The Federation has seen fit to promote me to the title of Emperor of the Vers Empire.' While jesturing to his six Versian Knights, who grouped into pairs of two and began to head into the crowd of lords, bringing them down one at a time to swear fealty to their new Emperor."</p>
        <p>Following Volkov taking the throne, he would institute a number of large reforms. These reforms are often seen as the founding period for the First Empire. The reforms themselves can be broken down into three major areas, Military Reforms, Economic Reforms, and Social Reforms.</p>
        <h4>Military Reforms</h4>
        <p>The first major area that Volkov would reform is the military of Vers. His new reforms allowed any lord complete ownership of their land, as well as creating three tiers of Aristocracy. The Lords, who must maintain a landing castle (and support fleet) capable of defending the lords ground holdings, as well as an army to man the castle. The Lord may also issue the title of Baron, who will administer areas of Land for the lord, and must themselves maintain a landing keep (and support fleet), as well as an army to work within it. As well, any Lord was able to create a new Knight of their choosing to administer an area of the Lords land, though less land then a Baron. The Knight would also be required to maintain a landing Fort (and the required support ships), as well as an army.</p>
        <p>As well, Emperor Volkov declared that Lords were free to fight among themselves to take land, and that while any Lord may create a Baron or Knight, the Knights and Barons could be transferred to another Lord with the original Lords permission. At the same time, the existing Steel Barons were all declared to be Part of Emperor Volkovs area. This would almost immediately make Volkov one of the most powerful people in Vers. Meanwhile it would anger the already annoyed Steel Barons, and even more importantly, their citizens.</p>
        <h4>Economic Reforms</h4>
        <p>Volkovs reforms would include large changes to the way Versian Lords had come to expect to be paying taxes, which was, not really at all. Volkov, on top of making lords fund their own militaries (though almost all the ship yards were now controlled by Volkov), they were also being taxed up to 40% of their personal income, and the Steel Barons were looking at up to 80% taxation. Given the relative economic prosperity of the Belt vs Vers, the Lords of Vers felt it only fair to tax the much more economically viable belt. The people of the belt, who were overworked, had horrible pay, and generally were treated as third class citizens continued to grow resentful of Vers. Especially because a large number of technological innovations had been found in the belt, only for the Barons or other Versians to arrive in the belt, take the invention and head home to resell it making a killing. This would lead to the Belters call to action: <a href="artekka">"Are Techa"</a></p>
        <p>The economic reforms would also have a large effect on Vers. Serving to make military service much more valuable as it was illegal to fire a solider. Very quickly societies stratification skyrocketed. The Military class became more then just the defenders of Vers, their higher pay also made the visibly above those who just toiled in the cities. As well, their closer proximity to the Lords and their Knights angered many common citizens. But any attempt on Vers to revolt was quickly put down.</p>
        <p>To the church, which was especially important in the large and powerful Germushian area of Vers, a large tax was applied. Stating that the church could either serve the state or itself, but not both. This would anger Lord Sigmar greatly and cause a lot of religious people to be drawn to Germushia, making it an even more powerful area of Vers.</p>

        <h2>Government</h2>
        <p>The modern Versian government is split between two houses, the Citadel and the Colossius. The Citadel is the peoples representation currently led by President John Hellsbeck. While the Colossius is headed by Empress Catherine Allussya, daughter of the now dead Emperor who renounced her claim to the throne decades before his death. Only to properly earn it through careful political maneuvering.</p>
        <p>Officially, within Versian society the Colossius has existed act as the Emperors court. Its parties are based on Oaths of Fealty, which can be called for at any time by the Empress. Should the current ruling family is whoever has the largest total number of votes, even if they didn't technically secure a majority. As well, when a lord swears fealty, those who swore fealty to that lord also have their oaths transferred to the person the Lord took an oath to.</p>
        <p>The Colossius itself sits in the capital planet of Allussya, in the capital city of Reverse. It currently seats 40 lords, including the empress and now-president John Hellsbeck. The Colossius itself is a massive coliseum designed to seat up to 500,000 people, which would have been enough to seat all the lords, and their knight commanders along with each knight commanders most loyal knights. It is divided into three seating rings, and the central floor. </p>
        <p> The highest ring is for viewers, officially any Civis may sit and listen, though by convention only the Aristocractic class attends. The mid level is for the knight commands, those who lead massive swaths of the Lords realms, and their impossibly large militaries. Finally, the lowest level of the seating ring contains the lords themselves. The ground floor is itself split into 4 sections. The "head" section is where the empress and her advsiors sit, so as to allow all the lords the chance to hear here, and see her, and to give her no place to hide from their questions. To the empress' left is the opposition table. opposite the empress is the inquisitors table, and to her right is the supporters table. Each table has room as 10 people to sit.</p>
        <p> Whenever a subject is called for a discussion, three parts are needed. The first part called forth is the inquisitor, the empress chooses someone (on the advice of her supporters) to conduct an investigation into a subject as assigned by the empress. The chosen inquisitor then comes down and takes the center seat at the inquisitors table. The empress then asks the inquisitor to advise her on who to call for the support of the concept, and then the empress asks for advice on who to call for opposition to the concept. The empress then cedes the floor to the inquisitor, and allows him to call his own witnesses to fact check anything brought up by the lords speaking their sides. The lords themselves may ask the empress to please summon any lord to their table to bring up facts. Once a lord has been brought to the table, they may not return if they are dismissed. This is designed to force the lords to carefully pick and conduct their arguments against one another. At the end of the debate, the question is raised by the empress to the Colossius' voting level (the first level) and the vote is held.</p>
        <p>If the supporting side wins the vote, they are then called upon to draft a bill in support of their premise, or present one if they have one ready. At which point the bill is then the subject of discussion, and changes are made until it passes a vote. At which point it is sent over to the Citadel for a final vote. </p>
        <p>The Citadel is then sent the bill. The president presents the bill to the floor, and a vote is held on whether the bill passes as is, or needs some revisions. If it needs some revisions it is sent back to the Colossius to be reworked. On the other hand, the Citadel may also draft legislation. Any member of the Citadel may present a peace of legislation to the floor, and if it passes it is sent to the Colossius for review. If it passes there it becomes law, otherwise it can be sent back to be reworked. But importantly neither house has the ability to flat out veto a bill.</p>
        <p>It is important to note the <i>area</i> in which the Versian government can legislate. Within the Versian empire, each lord is the master of their land. This puts strict restrictions on what the Government can pass. Taxation is forbidden, as is anything directly limiting what a lord themselves can do. Though restrictions can be placed on Lords and enforced in the Colossius, and benefits can be given as well to encourage or discourage behavior. This allows those lords who truly wish to, to ignore basic things like human rights, at the expense of heavy restrictions and tariffs.</p>
        <p>The Colossius also, unlike the federation, adjudicated the legality of war. Wars simply happen. The Colossius <i>only</i> intervenes when there are new lords, or the ending of a noble lineage. In the latter case, the banner is hung in the hall of mourning in the royal palace.</p>
        <p>New lords are created whenever a lord wishes to give up their control on a number of systems. Initially it was any number of systems but today the threshold for it to be a new lord requires at least 1000 planets, and some degree of economic viability. As well, it is then put up to a vote within the Colossius if this lord should be created.</p>
        <p>It is vitally important to note that Lords within Vers are <b>vastly</b> different then their Federation counterparts. In the Federation, lords are subservient to parliament. Ultimately the lords are restricted as citizens of the Federation. In the Vers empire, for the most part the lords were the top level of government with absolute immunity outside of the Colossius. Even today the Citadel is still subservient to the Colossius. Lords within their realm in Vers are absolutely above the law because they are the law, and not even the Colossius can tell them what to do. In the Federation lords are importantly still able to be tried in Federation courts. They are still held to Federation laws.</p>
        <p>It is best to think of the Vers empire as tight alliance of independent fiefdoms, bound only by agreements of what not to do to each other.</p>
        <h2>Army</h2>
        <p>
            The Versian military is unique to each lord in grand size, but up to the point of where the Knight commands, the armies are uniform. The numbers displayed here represent standard troop units, and the average across all 40 current lords is used for Knights and Knight-Commanders.
            <ol>

        <h3>Weapons of the Army.</h3>
        <p>
            The Versian army users a variety of weapons produced by IRok Armories, specifically the Longshot lineup of firearms. Specifically the Versian Army uses the following IRok Longshot weapons:
            <ul>
                <li>Longshot M1R1 - No scope, 60 round magazine, 120 round internal magazine. 5 Round burst before recoil can hit, as well as semi-automatic. Special ammunition for using bolt option. (Civilian, Military Contractor, Original)</li>
                <li>Longshot M1R3 - Scoped, 60 round magazine, 120 round internal magazine, 3 round burst before recoil. Full auto, semi auto, and burst. Special ammo bolt for single round. (Vers Standard Infantry Rifle)</li>
                <li>Longshot M3R1 - Scope, 180 round magazine 140 internal round mag fired from the back. Full auto and 3 round burst. 12 round special ammo loaded with bolt from central magazine well. (Versian light machine gun)</li>
                <li>Longshot M3R2 - Scope, 14 round special ammo front bolt, 60 round rear loaded rifle rounds with options for semi and 3 round burst. Bolt for loading special ammo. (Versian sniper/anti-material rifle)</li>
            </ul>
            the naming convention is: LONGSHOT Mark(1/2/3) Revision(1/2/3/4/5).
        </p>
        <p>The Longshot is currently on its third Mark(Version) and fourth Revision(variant) of that Mark. The first mark had 3 revisions, the first revision is the base model, the second revision added a scope, and the back magazine was a magazine well for the bolt feed, and adding full auto. The third revision switched to a three round burst to conserve ammo, and reverted the special ammo well back to a normal magazine well. but maintaining the loading bolt for special ammo when needed.</p>
        <p>The second mark switched the primary magazine feed to the rear magazine well, but maintained the original internal 120 round magazine. The forward magazine well became the hold for special ammo and is loaded by the bolt. The first revision changed the scope and forward magazine </p>
        <p>The weapon itself uses a proprietary caseless cartridge, that allows the weapon to rapidly fire rounds and fead the massive internal magazine and unique firing bolt system allowing for quick cartridge acquisition.</p>
