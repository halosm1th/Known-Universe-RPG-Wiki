<h1>Specialized Magic</h1>
<p>Each of the specialized magic groups focus on one of the four planes besides the material for their spells. While Specialized casters don't have the versatility of <a href="/Rules/Magic/FreeFormMagic/">Free Form Magic</a> or the generic un-specialized spells of <a href="/Rules/Magic/CircleMagic/">Circle Magic</a>, the Specialized Magic areas tend to be very focused, and easy to cast, but underwhelming, but if they go off well, their abilities scale amazingly. </p>
<p>To cast a Specialized Magic spell, refer to your spell list, pick a spell to cast, insure you have enough Psi-Points to cast it, and if you can, then make an Easy Psi + your specialization of magic skill check, the spell should list the effects as well in its scale.</p>
