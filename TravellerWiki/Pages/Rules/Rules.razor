<h3>Rules</h3>
<p> The rules of this game are inspired heavily by Mongooes Traveller second Edition.</p>
<p>The core mechanic is done by rolling your chosen die as a player VS the assigned challenge level by the DM, with the relevant modifiers. Though this is generally thought of as 2D6, with Normal being DC 8+ on 2D6.</p>
<p>I also use a number of house rules and hacks to the way things work in traveller.</p>
<p>As well, the various magic systems used within the game are from house ruled together.</p>
