                "The Versian concept of gender is different the current or modern concept of gender, which is more akin to that of the United Federation of Earth. The largest two differences are: that Versian Gender is completely divorced from biological sex in any way, and that Versian gender is extremely fluid - to the point where someones gender may change during a conversation. This is because Versian gender is based on ones current actions, and the motive behind them. As such, the Masculine gender is generally noted for being active, and dominant, while the feminine gender is noted for being passive and submissive. " +
                $"However, it should be **stressed** that this is based on ones current actions, not on any deterministic train of ones biological sex. As due to advanced genetic modification biological sex, like biological race, eye colour, hair colour, or other physical traints are completely open to remodeling. This practice is especially prominent among [Versian Aristocratics]({WikiInformationArticles.GetArticleLinkIDByName("Versian Aristocratics")}) as an expression of their wealth",

                        "The modern Versian concept of gender is extremely fluid, and based on one’s current actions, and the motivation behind them. Within Versian society, the Masculine gender is regarded as the active or dominant gender in a situation. More specifically, one is considered Masculine if one is doing something of their own volition, or to suit their own goals. The Feminine gender is regarded as the passive, or submissive gender in a situation. More specifically, one is considered Feminine if they are doing something on behalf of another, or to forward someone else’s goal. ",
                        "For example, a Knight hunting pirates in their system is masculine, because they are choosing to deal with the pirates of their own volition. While a Knight fighting for their Lord is considered feminine as they are fighting to advance their Lords goals. Generally, a good solider is considered Feminine, while a bad solider is considered masculine. A stay-at-home father would be feminine, while a working mom is masculine.",
                        "As previously said, Versian Gender is quite fluid. A student may well be masculine while at home watching TV and eating cereal, but become feminine while receiving instruction in school, only to revert to masculine during recesses as the head of their peer group, while the rest of their peers remain feminine.  Over the course of a conversation a Knight may go from masculine to feminine and back again as their Lord makes their mind up about what to do.",
                        "Further complicating matters is that Gender and legal status are closely intermingled. This is because **all** rights are defined by a feudal contract. The person fulfilling a feudal obligation is considered masculine (as they have chosen to follow through on the obligation and are thus active) and the one calling for the obligation to be fulfilled is feminine (as they have chosen to call on someone else, and thus are passive). But when one is calling on a right from the feudal liege, they are considered feminine as they are being submissive to their feudal master, and the one fulfilling the called-on right is considered male as they are the active, dominant force being called on to enforce the right.",
                        "An implication of Gender related rights is that some rights depend on the Gender of an action. For example, it is against the law for any other man/masculine person to enter the Master of a House’s inner-sanctum, however women/feminine people are granted the right to be invited into the sanctum. This is because to overthrow your Master is an Active/Male gender trait, so anyone doing such an action in their Master’s office are given another reason to be charged, while also granting the feudal Master an even higher degree of power over their subject while also reenforcing the power differential between Master and Subject.",
                        "A further aspect of Gender in the Vers Empire is how Gender relates to Honour and Glory. Honour is considered masculine in Versian society, as in Versian culture it is believed that one Gains Honour from *their* actions. While honour is shared among one’s family, title, and self, honour itself is only gained for all of those things through one’s own actions. Thus, because honour is something one goes and gains for themselves in Versian Society, it is considered masculine. Glory is considered feminine in Versian society because glory is earned. What that tends to mean to Versians is that one earns glory in the service of their master, and because it is gained as part of service to their master, it is feminine. Thus, it is glorious women who are great inventors and form the basis of awesome tales, but honourable men who found companies or lead armies.",
                        "This has practical affects in the language used by Knight to Soldier vs a Lord to their Knight. A Knight calls on their troops to fight for glory, while a Lord asks their Knights to join them in battle for honour.",
