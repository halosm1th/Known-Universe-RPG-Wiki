                "The Knights in the Vers Empire who have magic powers and are trained in how to use them. Dating back to the earliest days of the empire, these Knights have worked closely with religious leaders and the Mages Guild to stick around throughout the various transtions of governments. Today the EOD serves the empress directly as their master, due to the requirements set on the EOD by the Sith Order during the Merging of Empires. The Knights are famous for their Orange Armour, Orange Void blades, purple capes with Golden trim, and most recognizable of all are the various tattoos of oaths embroidered on the most devote.",

                        "### Founding(~3091)\nThe Equites Ordinis Deorum traces its roots to days of the proto-Vers Empire, in the Lordship of Germushia, then held by Lord Troyard. He granted his Knights request to form a study group with several other Knights, Mages from the Guild, and senior people in the Lordships sizeable church. This laid much of the foundation of the EOD, a mix of Magic, Religion, and Knighthood.",
                        "#### First Versian Civil War(~3121)\nWhen then knight Sigmar achieved his title, he joined the EOD, in this same period, the First Empire was forming. One of the reforms brought on by Emperor Alexi Volkov I was granting the Equites Ordinis Orbitalis the ability to confirm new Knights without needing the approval of the emperor. With this change, the number of knights and complexity of Knighthood increased greatly. Sigmar then had a much larger cast of recruits to draw from for his own Order. Once it reached a reasonable size, Sigmar approached the emperor himself to request a _Charter of Rights_ for his Order. An agreement was reached whereby the Equites Ordinis Deorum would have its Charter in exchange for devoted service to the Empire, their Lord, and the emperor, as well as adherence to service to the Mages Guild. Sigmar quickly agreed.",
                        "#### The Three Knights\nCharter in hand, the EOD served a major role in the Versian Civil war, most famously were the three Knights: Resnov, Heidren, and Jarsol who liberated the Asteroid-Barony of Seguel without any other assistance. The mission is said to have begun with the three crashing a stolen tradership into the asteroid-bases shipyard/docks. The trio who had ejected an hour earlier, float through space using minor thruster power and the stations internal gravity system to coast towards it, until they were close enough that they were able to use their combined magic-powers to cast a spell which turned all oxygen within the station into methane, which took effect within moments of the ships impact, destroying the station and the asteroid. *The three were martyred by the super-accelerated debris from the explosion.* In their honour, the **Oath of Debris** was written.",
                        "#### Council of Mages and religious reconciliation (~3349)\nFollowing the First Versian Civil War, the battered and beaten empire limped through recovery. The Lords of the empire grew in strength due to their ability to fund expeditions to nearby Solar Systems using the new Aldnoah Drives. The Lords dispatched their Knights in landing-castles to take the new holdings for the Lords. Once the planets were under a Knights control, the lord often send new Knights to assist the one controlling the world, creating a Knight commander and his fief of knights, who would often be given control over various towns or minor settlements on the new world, or within the system to manage and govern for the Knight or Lord in their absence. ",
                        "Due to this, the number of knights continued to boom. While Sigmar had taken most of the empire’s religious population, and the Mages Guild took many more, those who remained and may eventually be eligible for knighthood had begun to embrace a variety of beliefs. Those on Vers itself most often took up either the Versian Pantheon of the Mages Guild, or the Cult of Sigmar from Pluto. While the pages and squires in systems shared with the Federation often practiced Jedi-ism, and of course any young one is enraptured by the tales of heroic witchers conquering the most fearsome creatures in the dangerous border regions, especially the children of nobles safely locked away in cities with enough protections that many witchers felt safe enough to go weaponless.",
                        "With the two issues in mind: the lack of candidates for knighthood due to the mage’s guild taking viable recruits, and strict requires for members of the Equites Oridinis Deorum to believe in the Versian Pantheon, a Council of High Mages was called.",
                        "Across the rapidly expanding empire, the greatest mages of each of the Regealia’s were summoned by request of the Emperor to Vers. _All_ attended the council. Along with the Mages, many of the greatest Equites dae Ordinis Deorum were asked to join the council. The Emperor made the councils purpose clear: find a way to get more Equites for the Oridinis Deorum. Two solutions were presented, one from the Knights who were present, the other from the Mages.",
                        "The knight’s proposition was to drop the religious requirement for the EOD. It was their order after all, clearly, they should be allowed to set the entrance requirement. The Mages Guild objected, citing that the Equites Oridins **DE**orum was a group whose power came from the God’s of the Mages Guild, and thus it was due to their Charter of Rights that the EOD fell within their realm. ",
                        "The Mages Guild instead offered to find a way to merge the growing and developing Witcher Pantheon with their own, and allow the EOD to study Jedi texts, as their knowledge was supposed to be secular in nature and thus outside the scope of the Mage Guild to regulate. The agreed to accept, but on the condition that members of the Mages Guild who _wanted _ join the EOD in an advisory role, as a librarian, teacher, or other form of academic or assistant, could do so, and in doing so could possibly work their way into a knighthood. This was agreeable to the Mages Guild, and the matter was settled. ",
                        "That agreement saw the birth of Versian Deorism, the dominant religion in the Versian Empire, most devoutly practiced by the Equites Oridinis Deorium. It merges the now ancient Versian Pantheon with the ever-evolving Witcher Pantheon, allowing Sigmoria to have a place, and through a crafty understanding of Jedi/Sith-ism has allowed for those religions to join as well. Effectively, Deorism is a hodgepodge of various religious that have brewed together out of necessity, and the groundwork for that brew was laid in the above deal. ",
                        "#### The Third AI War and the Knight Kenrus’ (~3363)\nThe Third AI War is perhaps the most famous war in all of human history. Its age means many have learned of its. Its political, social, economic, scientific, and other effects are incalculable. As a result of this war, humanity for the first time, across all major powers, agreed to outlaw the development of advanced, sentient, artificial intelligence. While it has  of course been broken more times then one can count, it serves as the foundation of anti-AI legislation in every major power in Universalis Confederation. It is thus no surprised that the Equites Ordinis Deorum played a vital role in this war. ",
                        "Overall, The Vers Empire was outside the reach of worst parts of the war (it was instead much more harmed during the first and second AI wars), but Vers itself was always at risk due to its proximity to Terra. The only time during the First Empire in which Equites dae Luna (EDL) landed on Vers was when a suspected Zalyn was thought to have infiltrated the House of Wagnar, posing as its Lord. Working with the EOD, the EDL was able to track down the false person and remove them before they could pose a real threat to Vers or Terra.",
                        "One of the most remarkable stories from the Third AI War for the EOD is that of Knight Kenrus’. Kenrus’ had been born in the Empire, but his family had heritage back to the Lordship of Germushia and were practicing Sigmarians. Kenrus’ had gained his knightly title fighting against a xeno’s invasion for his Lord – he had snatched the lords void-blade and charged head long at three of the elite-warrior class aliens, drawing on instincts he had not known he had, with lighting speed he struck down all three of the warriors, then returning the blade to its proper owner and apologizing for his abrupt usurpation of weapon. The Lord agreed to allow it on the Condition that Kenrus’ take up a knight hood. As word of his deed spread, Kenrus’ was invited to trail for the EOD, and soon joined in full.",
                        "During the Third AI War, before the Empire itself joined the war in proper form, Kenrus’ returned to the lands which had once been colonized by the Lordship of Germushia. The planet Rovterras was under Zalyn Siege, and Kenrus’ had joined a Sigmar battle barge on route to the word, and led the ground assault due to the absence of a proper light-seer. Marching with the Sigmarians into battle, Kenrus’ loudly recited the Versian variant of the Sigmarist Battle Hymn to the rhythm of shot from his pistol and strikes of his sword while the Sigmarians recounted their own hymn to the sounds of their own Ming-Corp™  rifle fire. After Kenrus’ finished using his powers to free a bunker of children under a school which had been trapped by rubble from Zalyn bombings, he heard from one of the teachers of survivors held up in a Sigmarist Temple not far away. Ordering his Sigmarine troops to remain, Kenru’s rushed to save the trapped people from the encroaching Zalyns.",
                        "He arrived not a moment too soon, as the last of the Light-Seers seemed to be on the loosing end of Sigmorias Gaze. The Zalyns heavy weapons were pounding the Void-bubble protecting the temple and the civilians within, its casters aged a year a minute. Kenrus’ used his pistol to stop ten of the Zalyn, but far too many remained. While using his blade to defend himself, Kenrus’ called on Sigmar and the Pantheon of other gods and used the training the Mages had given him to bring forth an army of angles, the bits of the shattered gods which Sigmar had been able to salvage, who repelled the demoness machines.",
                        "Kenrus’ would live through the whole war, after previous story, he would go on to liberate several dozen systems from the Zalyns before the Versian Vanguard arrived. He was part of the party who defeated the final Zalyns, scattering what was left deep into hiding. For his fame in the post war world, he became a Knight-Commander, and eventually gained the title of Lord in the Reverse Galaxy. Unfortunately the title would die out during the First Republic Period, but Knight Kenrus’ legacy lives on within the EOD.",
                        "### Second Empire ~4891\nDuring the Second Empire period the role of Versian Knight Changed greatly, as such, the EOD was forced to adapt to the new reality. The largest change was the shift back to allowing free or unlanded Knights again. This allowed for the ranks of the Knights to swell in size once again, and the EOD to gain its pick of members. However, this new period came with many changes, as the growth of knights and the empire as a whole required the restructuring of Knightly society, and acceptance of larger religious changes; namely the newfound dominance of Witcherism among the nobility.  ",
                        "#### Witcher Expansion and religious Changes ~4391-8391\nFollowing the rise of the First Terran Empire, the Witcher Order took control of the Milky Way Galaxy, and the governments of the major powers were forced to flee with them. The EOD itself was split, as it technically had service to the Lords, but it really had been a tool of the Emperor. As such, the EOD properly continued with the Versian Empire as it fled, while in the Milky Way the EOD became another branch of the Witcher Order, a title held by those Witchers who had been put in charge of Versian worlds.",
                        "As such, when the empire returned and retook their lands from the Witchers, the EOD was easily able to return to its spot, and many were willing to welcome back a non-Witcher source of magic education. In the waning days of the First Empire, the EOD had grown staunchly anti-witcher, relying heavily on its Versian Pantheon.",
                        "That changed moments after the First Empire died with its Emperor, and the Second was crowned by a Witcher believing, civis-born, wrongfully promoted knight who had usurped the Emperor for his position, and seemed to have great support in doing so! The EOD was left with little choice but swear allegiance to the new emperor and hope for the best.",
                        "Rather then mess with a good thing, the emperor left the EOD be for the most part, besides requiring that the Witcher pantheon be brought in line and that its names be used as the primary name for the gods. These minor changes left the EOD in a new position, but the changes the new emperor made to the Knighthood were of much larger benefit to the EOD.",
                        "#### Reorganizing the Knighthood ~4891\nThe new emperors reorganization of the Knighthood mostly involved the reintroduction of Free-Knights, meaning anyone whom the Ordered allowed to become a Knight could become one. This resulted in a large boom in the number of Knights, and as such the EOD’s ranks began to swell.",
                        "Within the Empire, the emperor ordered knew knightly titles be drawn up, setting down the current ranks of the Versian Knights: Page, Squire, Knight, Knight Sergeant, Knight Lieutenant, Master Knight, Knight Captain, Knight Commander. As well as granting many Charters of Rights to new orders. However, the EOD remained the sole organization for Knights of any religion who wished to refine their beliefs or magic into a battlefield artform.",
                        "#### Mages Guild War / The Life of Knight Janus ~26528\nA pivotal moment in Versian history, The Mages Guild War was a the result of the two competing Mages Guilds disagreements growing continuously more heated. The Versian Mages Guild was the smaller of the two, with most of its members in the ‘old world’ Milky Way Galaxy. The majority of the Versian Mages Guild’s members were that of the Equites Ordinis Deorum, and the Pre-Witcher Lords. The Witcher’s Mages Guild had more mages in it, and most of the Second Empire’s Lords supported it, as well as the Emperor.",
                        "The War initially simmered as small, mostly verbal, conflicts between members of their respective guilds. Many Lords began to openly pick sides and deny the other entrance into their lands, which was considered a violation of Versian Law and the Guilds’ rights.",
                        "When appealed to the Emperor, he declined to intervene, saying that the Charter of Rights only allows for there to be one Mages Guild, and so while there may be two factions, it is within a Lords right to favour one internal faction over another. Members of the Witchers Guild found this unacceptable, and decided to demonstrate their perceived insanity of the ruling by purging their Guild Halls and Worlds of Versian members, banning there entrance to Witcher aligned worlds. And with that, the battle lines were drawn, and the war began.",
                        "Mages need not use starships to travel between nearby system; a large enough cohort of Mages may simply choose to tunnel through the void themselves and travel to another world. This is often how the most destructive battles of the war began. Mages quickly shifted up in the scale of objects they hurled at one another. Starting with stones, to cars, shuttles, ships, buildings, then escalating to: asteroids, moons, planets and eventually suns. The destruction of this war was enormous, across both galaxies in which the empire operated.",
                        "The Emperor was forced to intervene, but struggled deeply between listening to the majority of Lords and their Godly Knights, or his heart, the minority of lords and the temporal knights. His initial solution was a failure: use the EOD as a strike force to fight against Mages battles where they occur, regardless of who started it, and without favour to either side. The failure of this plan came quickly, as mages would move, fight, and move on long before the EOD with their ships and personnel could be called, raised, and arrive. Lords soon shifted to personally instructed the EOD to lead local taskforces to knights to hunt down and purge any Guildhall who failed to swear fealty to the Lord above all and sign away their right to carry arms or commit violence.",
                        "The Emperor, not wanting to appear disempowered, finally issued a decree ordering the EOD to support the Versian faction of the Mages Guild, but if any Witcher faction whished to remain and laid down their arms to do so, they would be offered protection in the Versian Guild.",
                        "The EOD was not without worry in this regard, as the story of the Life of the Knight Janus tells. Janus had spent most of the war watching over a series of systems with a group of knights he was training and had negotiated a settled peace between the Witcher and Versian factions within.",
                        "This was disrupted however when his lord took the mattes of the war into his own hands, and order Janus to remove the Versian Mages, spitting that they were heretical, backwards vermin not even deserving of worship in the Godly Versarians triangular Churches. Janus gathered his Knights and complied with the order. Sending a Page ahead of his journeys, carrying a message.",
                        "By the time the Knight’s arrived to purge the Guildhalls, they found empty chambers, libraries without books, and no hint as to where its members may have gone. Within a few days Janus received word that the Witcher Guilds had recently had a large influx of new members.",
                        "When Janus received the word from the Order that the Emperor had commanded the protection of the Versian Mages, Janus dispatched the same pages to the Witcher Halls to tell them of the news. Within a few weeks, Janus was informed that the lost Versian Guildsman had been discovered, and that those same guildsmen now controlled the Witchers Halls! _Janus was executed by his Lord for failing to properly see through the Lords commandment; misreporting success to his lordship; and failure to enforce the emperors will.",
                        "#### Sigmarism bend, Failing to stop a Crusade ~34895\nWhile the Germushian Empire was facing internal collapse, a mad ruler who was hated by his people, the Church of Sigmar was vying for power and autonomy from the Germushian State. At the same moment, the _Dicollossius dae Vetparis_ (the local legislative body), decreed that Church of Sigmar was actually part of the Versian Empire, and attempted to merge the ideological beliefs of the Church into the empire. This was considered a great spiritual and legal wrong by the Church, who decreed the Empire heretical, its government heretical, and any who joined its so-called church heretics. It then called on all good servants of Sigmar to join the Sigmarines, Inquisition, and Light-Seers of the Germushian Church in a great Crusade to liberate the true believers trapped under this flagrant violation of Sigmarist belief.",
                        "While the Church rallied troops from across the Milky Way, garnering great support from every major nation besides one: Vers, who had instead become the target of trillions of newly found Siginf and their Sigmarine betters. For the Mages Guild, who were already having to deal with the physical threat posed by the Light-Seers and Librarians of the Church, they also had to navigate merging the new Verisan-Sigmarist religion, Lightseers, believers, and ideas into their Guild and its teachings.",
                        "For the Knights of the EOD, they were attempting to merge the beliefs in their Lord as a supreme deity, with their legal obligation to defend their Lord from invasion as was currently underway by the Church’s forces, and also navigate its legal obligation to assist the Mages Guild, who was undergoing the same Church reforms, and who if the EOD deviated to far from, could become the enemy of the EOD.s",
                        "The Crusade itself can be best described as a great victory for the Church. In the earliest days of the Crusade, the EOD were dispatched to various Churches throughout the area who refused to convert to Versian Sigmarism. The churches were either forced to convert, entered into an armed standoff between the congregation and the Knight, or were outright destroyed – in one particularly notable case, a knight who had previously been a devote Germushian Sigmarist, called upon his Lord as a conduit to Sigmar to smite down the impure house before him, then using his own powers to bring forth a bolt of Void Energy leaving only a crater where once the church sat. Such harsh actions only further riled those who believed in Sigmarism throughout the Galaxy and affirmed the justness of their crusade.",
                        "The second stage of the Crusade went worse then the first. The Empire lost 65% of its land, hundreds of trillions of dead civis, billions of dead soldiers across countless worlds. The empire lost more ships, military and civil personal, and territory then it had in all the wars it had fought that millennium, and the previous two, combined. The Empire EOD fought valiantly, but even the reforms which had previously swelled its ranks were not enough to feed it. The New empire in Reverse had much higher membership, and they hadn’t even heard of the (official only) proposed merging of Sigmarism yet, let alone had their Collosius confirm it.",
                        "The EOD suffered major losses in its own right, severely depleted in the Galaxy, they had abandoned the goal of defending Churches and other religious buildings, with most Knights returning to fiefs if they had, otherwise assisting their fellow knights in keeping hold of their fiefs. Unity among the Lords and Knights had been broken. The crusade was an unstoppable wave which would obliterate all in its path, the best any knight could hope for was to shelter the storm without loosing everything.",
                        "The third phase of the crusade started off appearing better for the Empire then the previous had. The Emperor had arrived in the Galaxy with several lords and a majority of their Knights in tow. However, the reinforcements quickly became depleted, and the Lords grew defiant when they learned the circumstances behind the war, and the emperors stubborn unwillingness to concede his unofficially granted title back to the Church. Instead, he wasted countless more lives attempting to hold on to an ever-shrinking amount of land.",
                        "Eventually it was too late, the emperor could not  deny that he was loosing, and under pressure from both the Lords he had brought with him, and what was left of the local lords, the emperor agreed to peace negotiations with the Church and relevant parties. The negotiations would take place on the journey back to Reverse where the treaty could be confirmed in the Collosius. But, before departing the emperor publically in the _Dicollossius dae Vetparis_ rejected the title which they had granted to him.",
                        "The rejection had great effect on the Mages Guild, but little effect on the EOD. As the EOD had developed into three fractionous sets of beliefs: The Emperor was the Sigmarian (the human embodiment of Sigmoria, aka God), and the Lords are his Sigmarettes; The Emperor was also the God Supreme who was Sigmaroria, who had been Sigmar and Gerald of Rivia, and the Lords are the Sigmarettes; or that the Emperor was merely a man, and the Lords were men, and the Church a separate entity from them. The first belief was common among those who were from the Milky Way, the second grew prevalent among those EOD members who had come to the Milky Way, and the Third most common among those who never visited the Milky Way.",
                        "The first two groups were able to work together to push the EOD to enshrine the first Oath to the Emperor and their Lords. Which saw the Emperor as the living embodiment of Sigmoria and the Lord Supreme, in a position equal to the Germushian Sigder, which was acceptable to both the Church of Sigmar in Germushia, and the majority of EOD members, while pleasing to the minority of survivors of the Crusade. This belief was not jostled when the Emperor and Collosius confirmed that the Versian Church Declaration had been wrong, Lords were not Sigmarettes and the Emperor was not the Sigmarian. However, the treaty did leave the door open to the interpretation that the Emperor was the Sigmarian. This overall line of thinking would be the basis for the Equites Ordinis Deorum’s Cult of the Emperor.",
                        "#### Service Till Death and the end of the Second Empire ~52556\nThe Cult of the Emperor reached its first peak at the very end of the Second Empire. The belief had become a doctrinal part of EOD teachings, the Emperor was the embodiment of the highest God, and the EOD were their servants, who depended on the Emperor for their power: political and magical.",
                        "The end of the Second Empire came during the 9th Imperial invasion of the Milky Way. During this invasion, the Trans-Galactic Empire (TGE) had exploited the internal chaos of the Federation following a series of destructive internal wars between Lords. Simiarly, the weakened Vers had only some small holdings in the Milky Way, like most of the other Great Nations. Thus the TGE assumed it would be unimpeded in its invasion of the United Federation of Earth (UFE). This belief was shattered when the UFE’s Fuhrer called on his friend and ally Empress Catharine Reverse Alluysia for assistance, and she answered by sending all Lords in the Milky Way to assist, and personally leading a large fleet of EOD members to assault the Empire.",
                        "For the Knights within the Milky Way, they began to lead wars against Imperial forces, while EOD members began battles of both blade and intellect against their Sith counterparts in the opposing Empire. Many Knights and even Lords recounted that it had been a brilliant game of interstellar Chess, let down by the ever-weak player: the UFE.",
                        "Many desperate battles and one massive fleet of Versian Lords, their Knights, and an Empress later, and a hole had been opened in the Imperial vanguard. Until then the vanguard had been scoring victory after victory against the UFE and Versian alliance. The Empress took her chance and led a fleet through the opening and into the heart of Imperial territory. While the EOD distracted the various Sith in the Area, the Empress lead her ship and a small fleet on a suicide mission into the Void-Gate. Many ships destroyed themselves by crashing into the massive ring. But the maneuver was a success. The gate was destroyed and the Imperial Fleet which was in transit and would surely have destroyed the UFE had been destroyed.",
                        "There was only one problem. The Empress was almost 5,000 years old. She had no living heirs, most had died in this war, and all who the crown could have fallen too were dead or otherwise ineligible. It was thus that for the first time in nearly 51 thousand years the Versian Empire was without emperor.",
                        "## First Republic ~52561\nThe First Republic is a highpoint of Versian society. The lack of emperor allowed Lords the ability to exercise more of their power, while self regulating into ‘fealties’ (swearing alliangce to one, essentially political factions) which governed in the Collosius. Meanwhile the thoroughly expanded empire, with many competing guilds in the Reverse galaxy, competed with each other while holdings lords and other lieges to the obligations which came with their rights. Economic prosperity brought on by the formation of the Banking Union, and eventually the Banking Guild meant far fewer wars between Lords. This period also saw a great increase in the new Titles of Lord, and the consolidation of old Titles.",
                        "Knights flourished in this age as well, though in a different manor. Gone were the days of warrior knight, instead now the purpose of a knight was to assist their lord, either in day-to-day tasks or in managing their Regalia. For the EOD they took their ability to call on other-worldly and social status as a call to serve the people, and without an emperor to build a cult around, the EOD’s religious beliefs were forced to adapt.",
                        "#### Service to Lords ~52891\nThe EOD adapted to the loss of their religious leader easily. They expanded on the idea of the Cult of Emperor, deciding that the Lords titles were the representation of one of the Gods from their Pantheon. The belief being that if the Emperor is the God Supreme, then the Lords – as the Emperors lesser but equals – must thus be the other Gods of the Pantheon. But their belief was only that the emperor was the embodiment of the God supreme, and the person themselves didn’t matter so much as the title of Emperor did. Thus, the EOD’s new belief in the idea that their Lords titles confedered the support of a god from the Pantheon. Thus, Knights would request to join the service of lords whose titles represented the Gods that those knights felt most aligned to.",
                        "It is for this reason, that the Titles represented the Gods who the Knights were believing in, that knights of the Order of the Gods devoted themselves to the service of their lords. And thus the _Oath to your highest master, the Lord (x)_ entered the cannon of EOD Oaths.",
                        "#### Devotion to the public ~54962\nSoon though, the Knights felt that devotion to their Lords alone was not enough. They could see that the empire was an organism greater then just the Lords, and their gifts had come from the Gods, but much like their title conferred service to the Lord and obligations to the people, then their service to their Lord as service to their God meant that in carrying out their feudal obligations they must also do so with their spiritual obligations.",
                        "For this reason, the EOD developed the **Oath of the Service to the Civis** and many knights turned from helping their Lords crush devils and demonic incursions, to instead using their powers to focus on dealing with inequality in the empire, bringing forth great amounts of food, fuel, or other resources as needed.",
                        "However, the monster hunting still happened, and those who took the **Oath of Protecting the Civis** become devoted members of the _Aeterna Proelais Daemes_, whose primary goal is hunting Daemons, but its generally fallen to them to deal with any otherworldly incursion. They are considered some of the top monster hunters in the Galaxy, and many Witchers take great honour on serving along side such famed warriors.",
                        "#### The deeds of Debonio; ~54,941\nDebonio; was a great Knight, and an exemplar of the period. She first entered the Knighthood transferring from the Mages guild, after spending thirty years to use her powers to help build school in rimword systems. With the extra training, knowledge, and prestige from the EOD, she was able to work out a deal with one of the Great Shipping Guilds of her day, whereupon once a week she should use her powers to produce enough food to feed a subsector in need, and the Guild would see to it that the food was delivered.",
                        "It was Debonio; who wrote the **Oath of Protecting the Civis** after helping repair a city following a meteor impact from a rogue Mage. She personally hunted down the mage and had their soul condemned to the Abyss. She then had the city issued a special charter, and a school of Mages installed whose sole job it was to protect the city from future attacks.",
                        "Debonio; was also famous for openly mocking Lords who failed to live up to their duties. Upon having dinner with Lord Pawchelerius – whose Patron god was supposedly the God of Wheat, but yet whose people had been in an expanding state of famine for nearly a century – wherein the Lord bragged about his plentiful food stores, and great amount of profit from selling excessive amounts of food, the Knight stood from the table announcing: “I would rather dine on rats with the Civis who beg outside your gates then listen to another word from the abyssal vermin who hosts this dinner”. Departing in a rush from the dinning hall, and true to her word having a meal with the starving civis beyond the moat of the Lords Castle, with food she brought forth from beyond the material world herself.",
                        "Upon another world, the Unions in service to the Nobles had gone on strike, claiming great abuses in the Noble houses. To investigate, Debonio; departed in disguise as a scab to work for the nobles. She quickly uncovered that the reports from those on strike had been but the surface, abuses of all forms were reigned down by the nobles on their servants. One day, upon a deeply dishonourable assault from a high ranking noble, Debonio; reveled who she truly was. The noble did not believe her and continued his attack. Debonio; crushed the nobles throat with her hand. She then went to the knight who governed the World and told them the whole tale. Upon discussion between the two, they agreed a new cast of nobility was needed, and granted numerous titles which once belonged to the vile nobles to the leaders of the Unions, and thus both they and their Unions were happy.",
                        "Debonio; was no stranger to the issues of religion either, she was a key member in settling the Mages Guild’s internal dispute about the nature of Sigmoria in the absence of the emperor. Her conclusion was that the emperor was not truly gone, simply gone from the eyes of the Empire. While it failed at settling the dispute, it was a core argument in the winning camps overall argument.",
                        "Thus,  it is that Debonio; was an exquisite example of an Equites from her age, working to advance the cause of the people, even in the face of previous oaths to the Lords, and unintentionally laying the groundwork for the eventual return of the royal family, and restoration of the Versian Empire.",
                        "### Third Empire ~68144\nIf the First Republic was *a* high period, the Third Empire is considered by most to be *the* high point, especially the pre-war empire, and many, especially youth, in the Fifth Empire are nostalgic for the Third Empire, especially those who didn’t live through it.",
                        "For the EOD, the Third Empire was a time of great change and uncertainty, followed by a time of triumph, which culminated in the Great War. This trend was true for most of Versian Society in this period.",
                        "The changes started with the return of Asselyum Tarkarias Skywin Vers Allussya, the long-lost descendant of lost Empress. Upon her return, a mass upswelling of popular support and their Guilds/Unions, combined with the support of a small but powerful royalist faction, and the informal support of the United Federation of Earth (as thanks), and her then fiancé, Ex-Fuhrer and now Emperor of the Trans-Galactic Empire, Johnathan Reid, also known as Darth Vampyrius. Asselyum won the support of the Collosius, and to her lineage the title of Empress returned. She then married Emperor Reid and began to merge the two nations together.",
                        "#### Merging with the Sith Order ~68170\nWith the two empires merging, a consequence was merging spiritual and governmental agencies. For the EOD, this involved merging with he Sith Order. The TGE mandated that their Supreme Grand Master Dark Lord of the Sith, and Emperor be one in the same. While Vers had a similar requirement of their emperor being endorsed by the EOD. It was decided thus that the Sith Order would merge with the Mages Guild, but those Sith who also held titles within the new, Third Versian Empire, would join the Equites Ordinis Deorum as Part of the Sith Guild.",
                        "The merger was done without too much overall difficulty, as the Sith officially fell into the same category as the ancient Jedi loophole. The first impact was caused by the mass number of Sith who joined. It would not be until the year 69,041 that the merging of Knight hood and System Ownership took effect. This was in large part due to the massive influx of new Knights who had come through the EOD from the Mages Guild by virtue of being ‘Title bearing’ Sith, which the Sith Order took to mean any Sith who had been granted the title of Darth or greater.",
                        "The second large impact was reopening of the question of allegiance. Sith were devoted to their Order, and by extension their Emperor. But a core trait of Sith belief is a strong libertarian individuality. The EOD had been operating without an emperor for over a millennium and had developed a cannon around helping the Civis and service to the holders of Lordly Titles. The culture clash was immediate and great. Fractures within the EOD about where the heart of their loyalties lied were quickly exploited by the Sith, pushing their own agenda. One focused on Devotion to the throne.",
                        "#### Devotion to the Throne ~68538\nThe Devotion to the Throne period of the EOD started with an alliance between the Royalists in the EOD and the Sith, against the divided Lordists and Civists. The Imperial alliance installed a mostly Sith group into the senior positions of the EOD, and who then reissued the **Oath to the Empress**.",
                        "Within the TGE politics, there was a devotion to precedent. The Sith were experts in law and combed the Orders ancient tomes searching for any possible precedent which could be used as the basis from which their ideas could be built in and reinstated these changes. For example, they reinstated the concept that Lords were Sigmarettes, but extended it, instead saying that *Dark Lords* were in fact Sigmarettes, and the Empress the Sigmarian. For the majority who were not Sigmarian, the royalist ideas were heavily championed, while the Civis supporters were actively discouraged. In their stead, a more Imperial culture developed within the EOD, and it developed a reputation within the Knights overall for being a ‘cold, cruel, uncaring institution of Godly Sciences beyond the sanest persons understanding.’ Long in the desperate to be forgotten past of the Third Republic the idea of the _Servants to the Civis_ remained.",
                        "#### Colonizer Kings and Simon Cortez ~68991\nThe true kickstart for the Third Empire was the declaration from the Empress of a project of unity, the one thing that unquestionably the two merging empires could agree on: Conquering a galaxy that had yet to have humans in it. One was chosen, and the Empress declared a new Era of colonization. Within a few decades she would decree that any knight who wished to retain their title would have to settle land for their Lords. However, the empress made the knights and lords an intriguing offer. She agreed to grant any lord or knight who was able to claim a system independent of the support of the empire the title of king for two and a half decades. In that time, the Lords would be approached as equals of the empress to discuss a trade agreement with the empire. Knights were granted an extra privilege, if they colonized a system for their Lord, and held a system within the Lords Regalia, then the Knight was free to transport any resources from their colonized land back to their imperial holding without any tariffs of added taxes. This made many Knights very rich, which further motivated the process of equating Knighthood to control over a system.",
                        "The TGE and Versian Empires had both been idle for far longer then either would have liked. The renewed call for colonization was greatly supported, especially among the EOD, who under Sith control had grown greedy and lost sight of protecting the Civis. They heeded their Lords calls for worlds, taking their landing keeps and forts and making for the new Asselyum Galaxy.",
                        "The Knights used their powers to Conquer and colonize worlds. Before they left, they raised great armies of newly joined Militorius eager for war and a chance at a life better than that of a Civis. Especially prominent were TGE Volunteers, eager for a chance at action. The Knight Simon Cortez raised a sizeable army and set out, hoping to use the powers he’d earned through the Equites Oridinis Deorum to conquer many worlds.",
                        "The first few systems he discovered were ruled by a small but well armed and deeply oppressive empire, who had enslaved the other inhabited species and used them as slaves for various purposes. Including using a species of enslaved stellar creatures as interstellar ships due to their ability to phase into the Aether. Cortez initially struggled against the threat, finding that Versian diplomacy seemed not able to succeed. His second tactic, drawing his pistol and shooting the ambassador, seemed to be much more successful, as Cortez quickly took the two-dozen system empire in less the three Months. With much more land under his belt, Cortez paid off his loans to his Lord, and recruited a few knights of his own, granting himself the title of Knight-Sergeant, much to the chagrin of the Equites Oridinis Orbitalis, but due to Cortez having taken land, which was officially outside the empire, they were powerless to do anything about it.",
                        "Cortez then led his knew knights on a campaign raving and raiding several weak nearby stellar nations, many of whom had only recently achieved interstellar travel of some form. In one case Cortez smashed through a dawning civilizations first attempt at a stellar craft, before crushing the worlds militaries and granting the system to his half-alien bastard.",
                        "As word of Cortez’s deeds spread, a large alliance of nations formed within the galaxy and approached Cortez with a peace offer. He agreed to meet if leaders of the nations met on a neutral world in a neutral system. The leaders agreed and they attend the meeting, opposite them was Cortrez alone, with his feet on a railing. Cortez sliced and ate an apple as the gathering of leaders issued their various request, concessions, and agreements. When Cortez had finished his apple, he stood, pocked the void knife he had been using to cut it, and tossed the rest of the finished apple core back away from himself while addressing the room:",
                        "“Leaders, _and delegates_, You have called me here to tell me of the limits on what I may do. But I ask you this: What power do you have to enforce these limits? For I have the power to destroy stars with twist of my wrist” he made a quick gesture with a wrist, ending with it poiting towards the large window in the hall where the meeting was taking place. Outside the window, the systems star could be seen. Moments after the words left the Cortezs’ mouth, an infinitely black circle appeared ‘below’ the sun, impossibly thin. The circle begun slowly dragging itself up along the sun, leaving behind only empty space where the star had once shone. The stunned room was further shocked as Cortez walked towards the doors into the hall, pushed them open, gave a cheerful wave, and then left.",
                        "Some in the alliance were not deterred, and they took Cortez’s actions as a declaration of war. Cortez was happy to meet such a challenge. His ever-increasing retinue of Knights, now under their ‘King’ were unquestioningly loyal.  This was in large part due to the fact that anyone who question Cortez was simply killed by him. Several of his lovers were given the same fate when they chose to question him in any aspect of his decision making, imperial, personal, or choices he made in their lives.",
                        "Cortez began to exploit old animosities between those he had scared out of joining the war and those who were at war with him, and so Cortez was able to gain a strong following of allies. The two groups of alliances battled one another, but Versian technological superiority, combined with Cortez’s willingness to use extreme tactics including destroying planets and cities in order to capture planets turned him into a demon to his enemies, and a hero to his followers.",
                        "Even when Cortez was on the brink, he called on old allies from the Versian Empire who had themselves become kings, or those who had desires to do so, and had them join him in war. His name was on the tongue of every novice in the EOD, hoping that once they had finished their basic training, they may go mentor under him. Every time Cortez used his powers to throw a planets moon at its capital city the Knights cheered for more.",
                        "Cortez would die during his war against the Great Alliance, though the war would live on long after Cortez, only coming to an end when the Empress declared the Age of Colonization over and required that any Knight who wished to keep their title, and their temporary autonomy, must stop making war with the Alliance, and a relatively short peace was negotiated.",
                        "#### Equites Ordinis Deorum in the Great War ~81841\nThe Equites Ordinis Deorum were instrumental in getting the Vers Empire into the Great War. As Xiao-Ming persecutions on Jedi increased in the Axion Galaxy, many Jedi fled to the United Federation of Earth as well as the Versian Empire. The Sith within the empire were especially empathetic to the Jed-I’s plight, and while they had lost their place as the heads of the EOD, they still were a powerful faction, and they held great say with the Imperial faction in the Collosius.",
                        "So it was that even before the Empire officially joined the war, many knights of the EOD had left to conduct a study term with the Jed-I. And when Xiao-Ming attacked the temples, the knights, their landing keeps, and their personal bodyguard of 5,000 troops, plus armour, air support, artillery, and other casual tools of war became vital instruments in the temple’s defenses.",
                        "Xiao-Ming eventually had enough of the proxy war and called on their ally, the Empire of Deutschland, for assistance. This started the chain of events that would eventually unfold into the Great War. But at the start, Vers was mostly focused on liberating the Axion-Alliance, and the EOD on defending their fellow mages, the Jed-I.",
                        "#### Axion Alliance Front and the Defense of the Jed-I temple ~81954\nThe majority of Equites in the Oridinis Deorum focused on defending Jed-I and other religious or spiritual centers of study from the Xiao-Ming voidforces. These sieges were a multistage process, as most Jed-I temples were on remote worlds, often without many other inhabitants, even if the system did have inhabited worlds. For this reason, Xiao-Ming would used a VoidForcer, given command of their own heavy cruiser and detachment of corporate marines to take over Jed-I temples.",
                        "Defending the temples with their lives, the EOD, Jed-I knights, and Versian military dug in. Landing forts had to remain in orbit to protect from the corporate ship, which limited the ability to deploy heavy artillery and super-heavy armour. The primary plan of defense were guerrilla attacks launched by Jed-I, attempting to confuse and draw off various corporate units, while armour, Infantry, and the Knights dug in.",
                        "Void shields would be raised, armies of the dead, angles, demons, in 3 reported cases Versian-Sith Equites briefly brought daemons into reality to destroy especially danger threats. If the Xiao-Ming cruiser could get a break on the Landing Keep (or better yet a kill, though that was a much greater challenge), it would attempt to deploy a wave of landing craft. The first few scouting waves were mostly infantry, but soon began to include more light armour, and by the fifth wave heavy armour and Jr. Void-Forces and intern Void-Forces would be deployed along-side them, in an attempt to exhausted the forces on the planet. The various plans had mixed results, but on average the better positioning of the temples (often remote, hard to reach locations), and the combined strength of the Jed-I and EOD, along with the latter often having plenty of combat experience from the period of Colonization, allowed them to eek out victory in many cases. Though it would be the Versian Lords and their imposing fleets, including tens of thousand's of knights with their own fleets, would be the major force in pushing back Xiao-Ming.",
                        "This meant that when Xiao-Ming helped Deutschland open a second front, Vers was quick to leap to help, joining the defense of Germushia shortly after Xiao-Ming declared war on it, though a sizeable time after the Federation had joined the war, which was also a sizeable time after Deutschland had initially declared war.",
                        "#### Germushia and the defense against the Kuromukuro ~82566\nIn the Berlinnic Galaxy, Germushia had been fighting a loosing war for a millennium, when the Federation finally joined in beyond just in name, the tide slowly began turning, which prompted Deutschland to ask the battered Xiao-Ming for assistance. Xiao-Ming replied by dispatching their experimental Kuromukuro program to the Berlinnic Galaxy. The suits themselves relied on jump drives to collectively launch from a strike carrier and arrive in a system, ambushing passing by ships until they could hide well enough, get onto planets and sow chaos and destruction.",
                        "Many Knights were dispatched to deal with the issue, but the EOD was given a special assignment from the Empress shortly before her death.  (*Note*: _this is Catherine Vers Allussya, daughter of Assylum Vers Allussya, the empress who restored the Third Empire_) The Equites Ordinis Deorum were to patrol the border region of the Deutschland Empire, where it was said Xiao-Ming forces had been raiding heavily, attacking planets that were completely unaligned.",
                        "On one such world, the Knight Tiberus’ was feasting with the planets greatest leader, having just made an agreement whereby the Knight would leave a super-heavy tank behind to deal with any Kuromukuro suits. As the two joined their wine glasses in a toast, the liquid inside splashed out as the room shook, gunfire filled the air outside, and more shocks were quickly felt after, twelve in total. The Knight’s Neural Net was pinged with data that his Fort had confirmed the arrival of twelve Kuromukuro suits, their jump rings had been detected four days away at systems edge.",
                        "The Knight, with only his Armour to protect him, his blade and pistol to arm him, and his powers to defend him, was the planets best shot at defense until proper forces could be raised and send from the Fort. Checking his armour for Aldminium Crystals, he soon used all he had in a single, intense, supercharged burst.",
                        "Heart racing, Tiberus’ used his powers to quicken himself beyond the speed of human perception. He then dawned his helmet, burst out of the rooms grand, stain glass window to Sigmar, and went towards the nearest mech, activating his void blade.",
                        "Sprinting up a cart, onto the awning of a house, and then another’s roof, Tiberus’ then leapt from the house onto one of the suits great cannons, running his blade along the guns barrel splitting it to. He continued his impossibly fast sprint along the suits arm, continuing to slice whatever he could, including cutting the shoulder void-energy turret. He then severed the head of the suit, pulled the pilot out, and threw him to the ground.",
                        "Two more suits approached the position, calling upon his powers once again, he brought forth from the void the energy to raise the suits massive sword, and began a suit against one of the suits. Towards the other approaching suit, Tiberus’ pulled on the damaged suits cannon, discharging it towards the unengaged but approaching suit. Now able to focus his whole attention on the duel, Tiberus’ called forth an angle, whom he handed control of the blade to. Leaving the cover of the suit that he had been hiding behind, relying on his already super-human, now near godly speed to protect him from the Kuromukuros auto-guided shoulder high-energy canon, Tiberus’ rushed forth. Slicing at the legs of the suit, bringing it to its knees, where he then jumped, amplified by his power, on top of the suits shoulder cannon, destroying it with his voidblade. He then went to the suits head and repeated the processes of removing the pilot.",
                        "He then called upon his powers once again to raise the machines themselves, and he gave them a spirit to defend him from the other suits, while he rushed forth and attacked them using his powers ot throw objects, himself (and sometimes objects off of which he would then throw him himself), destroying the attacking suits.",
                        "Planet saved, Tiberus’ apologized to the leader for destroying his window, but gave his word (and dispatched and message to his ship saying) that he would leave behind a large group of super heavy tanks and troops to defend this world until a new knight could come to watch over it.",
                        "### Second Republic ~83356\nThe dawn of the Second Republic marked the start of the end of the Versian Golden Age. The Empire who had triumphed in the great war, walking away with the fewest losses of any nation, only land gained, and little of its industry or facilities destroyed. The Empire was by all accounts ready to lead the way forward. ",
                        "The only problem was that the Empress Catherine had died during the great war, leaving her depressed, alcoholic, Federation born husband to rule the empire, with a son who as considered too inexperienced to take over, and their monarchs only remaining daughter, Camilla Vers Allussya having renounced her family name and personal claim to the throne to earn her rank in the Knighthood. It is said that Camilla was with her mother the day the Empress passed. However, Camilla chose to stay on the front, launching a successful counterattack which secured the besieged planet moments after the Empress’ was mortally wounded by debris from a successful Deutschland bombing run.",
                        "With the war over and his wife dead, the Emperor grew greatly depressed, and gave up on running the empire. The Emperor instead chose to introduce the Citadel, which would be composed of officials elected by the Civis, who would debate and vote on what legislation went forward to the Collosius.",
                        "Shortly after establishing the Citadel and granting power to first President: Apocdecaeli. Under this president the empires stock market would hit its greatest peak, his single motivation the enrichment of himself and his supporters.",
                        "#### Post war decline and rampant corruption ~83351\nThe EOD was not insulted from the Changes. Apocdecaeli’s reforms led to a massive appearance in increase of trade, but in the same period actual production decreased greatly. As the stock market reported more success, more factories closed. The Free Men, their aristocratic patrons, and their liege the Knight all benefited greatly, earning credits hand over fist. Eventually even distributing free food to the increasing in size masses of starving Civis, who were out of work and growing more restless.",
                        "With the ever-increasing amounts of money in the economy and wealth of the Aristocrats, the separation between themselves as the Civis became more pronounced. Nobles moved off world, either to stations in orbit or into private moon bases.  The landing ports and great palaces of the planets soon were fenced off, and the Militorius placed on constant patrol.",
                        "Police stopped enforcing laws for anyone who couldn’t pass them a year’s worth of wages in advance. As the increasingly displaced Civis began to leave Hubworlds, the fragile economies of many agri-systems began to collapse as they could not sustain the massive influx of new people. But too the stock market things appeared better then ever. Thus, neither the President who was profiting off of the chaos, nor the emperor who was cowering from the chaos, noticed or cared about the falling apart empire.",
                        "This lack of care was felt by the Knights of the empire, especially the EOD. The Sith Order’s selfish influenced reached a fevered pitch. With EOD members refusing to serve those who could not pay them for the spell. Gone were the days of the using the Emperor and Gods gift to help the people of the empire. Now magic was a science, and like the Idea Creators, the EOD should be paid for the use of their talents. This caused many who were not of the Sith beliefs to leave the EOD, some, like Ex-Knight Celestius went as far as renouncing their title in whole.",
                        "#### Ex-Knight Celestius ~83358\nCelestius was ancient. He was tried in the school of Service, by one who had studied under Debonio;. It is said that Celestius had argued with Cortez about the morality of the colonizers action before the colonizer met his death. Celestius served in the Great War, including being with the when the Empress when she died. Celestius at first attempted to use the godly magic to heal the empress. But it did not work. Celestius would not move from the empress’ side until she was given her final rest. In recognition of his service, Celestius was raised to a Knight-Commander of the Emperor.",
                        "It was in this position that Celestius truly gained his fame as a champion of the people, a paragon of good and truth in an age of evil and lies. Celestius was said to regularly storm into the Citadel and roar a speech to its members on their unethical actions. In one noteable instance Celestius even had a regiment stationed around the Citadel, preventing its members for entering for a vote which would have removed the Right of Knights to promote their own members, instead making it a choice by the Citadel. But no matter how much the President might have wanted Celestius gone, he had been inducted into the Equites Oridins Orbitalis, making him untouchable to political, or social coercion. No Knight nor Militorius would dare move on one of the 36 Orbitals – to do so was not just death in this life, but their very soul being sentenced to infinite service in the Abyss, assuming they a soul left to send once the Orbital Knight had finished with them, as well as a social death as no one would dare associate with an Orbital Killer. This was the protection Celestius operated under while as a Knight.",
                        "Celestius was active in trying to stop the collapse of the Empire. Politically he lobbied to introduce stronger regulations on banks, and the stock market. Actively, he worked to support the Civis by using his powers to create food and other supplies for them, dispatching troops to deal with pirates and other brigands as best he could. But the imperial collapse far outpaced one mans attempt to do good.",
                        "The final straw for Celestius was neither the open bribery within the EOD (including allowing several Knights with no connection to the Gods into the Order), nor the selfish desire for more from the Lords. It instead came from the ascension of the new emperor: Emperor Charles Vers Allussya. Celestius had hoped the new emperor would take charge and change things, restore the empire to its former glory. Instead, Charles followed in line with Apocdecaeli’s plans, fervently pursuing his own wealth at the expense of the empire. Celestius stayed as a Knight for a short while longer. But as the imperial stock market collapsed, the supposed wealth disappeared, and the disgruntled lords of Revese and Palpatinius Galaxies began to voice opposition to the demanding change. The response from Emperor Charles was to send Celestius to put down the wicket and traitorous lords.",
                        "Upon his arrival. Celestius discovered the starving Civis pleading 30 meters from the gates to the Lords Palace. The area between the wall of Civis and the gates was strewn with bodies. Many having bullets placed through them, others starved to death while trying to find a shred of food. When the crowd recognized who Celestius was, they swarmed him hoping for a miracle. Initially reluctant, it was only when a young boy, no more then 12 approaches. A small half eaten rat in was in the boys’ outstretched hands, while the boy boastfully asked the Knight if he would care for a bite of this prized catch. Stifling his upset stomach, the Knight called on his Fort to dispatch food as soon as possible. Celestius then brough the young boy into the palace with him.",
                        "Within the glittering palace, the boy and Knight marched to the banquet hall. Within at least two dozen Lords sat around a table so filled with food that even the most wasteful eater in the emperor’s palace would feel ashamed. The boy sprinted to the table, filling his mouth with everything he could. The nearest Lord smashed a fist into the boys back, causing the boy to sputter up bits of half eaten food while the lord chastised the boy for running, his lack of manners, lack of respect, and failure to use utensils. The Knight responded by removing the Lord’s head with Celestius’ void-blade.",
                        "An uproar broke out in the room, calls for the guards were met without action. None in the Militoius would move against an Orbital Knight, even if their Lord commanded it, as all in the room did. The Knight instead told the boy to pause from his meal, and to instead lead a group of guards in taking the food out to the starving masses. The Knight then told no one in particular that if he did not see the boy again, in good health and free, before leaving, then the Knight would personally see to it that the boys second closest heir would become Knight of this World while his closest would take the title of Lord from its current holder. The knights’ orders were followed without question.",
                        "The enraged lords took their credit-purses and went to the Emperor, who soon agreed that in exchange for the right sum of money, Celestius could loose him position as a member of the EOO. Something which was unthinkable to any other emperor. To protect the EOO, and EOD, Celestius chose instead to renounce his title in its entirety, while openly denouncing the emperor as a traitor and a fraud. The Ex-Knight Celestius would go on to find great power and sway in the United Reverse Lords, where he was granted the title of Lord by Supreme Lord Commander Richard.",
                        "### Forth Empire ~ 83366-83381\nWhile many may bicker about the what the Golden Age of the Versian Empire has been, there is no dispute that its darkest age was that of the short lived Fourth Empire. The Fourth empire came into existence when President Apocdecaeli attempted to implement reforms which would salvage a bit of the failing stock market. Emperor Charles disagreed with this course of action, and in response declared a new empire, and the end of the Citadel. These reforms were mostly allowing Lords to buy their independence from the Empire, founding Britannia and the United Reverse Lords.",
                        "The new Emperor wanted to reclaim his lost lands and restore the empire to its former glory and wash away the second republic as a small mistake, to be forgotten as a footnote in the history text. Thus, he launched what many called (the most recent) Versian Civil war, in an ultimately futile attempt to reconquer the Reverse Galaxy. In the process, he lost what would come to be known as the Imperial Versian Federated Territories, and what was left of the Vers Empire in the Reverse Galaxy. ",
                        "#### Actions in the civil war ~83366-83376\nDuring the relatively short civil war, the EOD played a pivotal role, their early start as a tool of the Emperor allowed him to quickly score numerous victories and quickly retake much land which had been given to the United Reverse Lords and other parties. It would ultimately be their perceived betrayal and change of beliefs which led to the _Purge of the Unworthy_ and ultimately a new chapter for the Order.",
                        "During the war, after swearing fealty to the Emperor, the Knights became the dominant force in turning battles. With squads of knights continuously being sent on impossible suicide missions, with the threat of losing their title, they kept pressure on the URL. The absolute minority who returned home from their missions refused to speak on their experiences. The few who did reveal horrifying tales, summoning abominations from other dimensions, ripping the souls from children who were being augmented with Aldminum injections to turn them into angelic soldiers. In other cases, the EOD’s Knights would pull the most terrifying creatures of the Civis’ mind, render them real and unleash them on vital worlds – including 9 attacks on hospital worlds, all directly ordered by the Emperor – causing great levels of physical and mental harm, destroying planets and lives. Stations would regularly be damned to planes for simply orbiting the wrong planet.",
                        "#### Forced Oath to the Emperor ~83366\nAt the start of the Civil War, the Emperor demanded that all Knights who wished to keep their place in the Brotherhood of Knights and thus their titles must retake the **Oath to the Emperor**. This became colloquially known as the **Force Oath to the Emperor**.  While formally being the same as previous Oaths. The Emperor lorded it over his Knight’s heads’ at all times, turning many off from serving him. The first group to try were shown the authority of an Absolute Emperor, by stripping the Knights of their titles, forbidding them from the brotherhood, and demoting them to Versarian status.",
                        "This was also indirectly responsible for many Knights, especially from the EOD, fleeing to Britannia. Those who chose not to flee to Britannia instead became traitors by joining the enemy, most often choosing the United Reverse Lords.",
                        "The fraction who remained loyal to the Emperor became the main leaders of his attempted conquest of Reverse. The attack was a success mostly due to Reverse being consumed with infighting, bureaucratic issues, and intra-national border conflicts leading to poor allocation of troops and resources. Supplemented by the fact that most of the Lords in Reverse had not engaged in any real violence in centuries, with many not even being involved in the Great War. This meant that while having fewer Knights and lords, by controlling more overall land allowing for more ships to be produced and people recruited, and with those Knights and Lords being more experienced in combat, allowed for the Emperor and his forces to gain many early wins.",
                        "By the end of the civil war, the now lightly seasoned URL commanders began to eek out victories. After the battle of Deverssigus, the EOD withdrew their support for the Emperor and ordered their Knights to return to their systems, on threat of disbanding the Order if any were excommunicated. With the EOD out of the war, many other Orders followed suit, allowing the URL to press their advantage, eventually leading to the duel between Supreme Lord Commander Richard and Emperor Charles. The duel ended with Charles’ death, and the return of Emperor Henry, the father to both Charles and Richard, former Emperor of the Empire; whose first child from his first marriage hates him and rules an opposing nation, and whose lost all but one of the children from his second marriage in which he also lost his wife. ",
                        "In the time after the civil war, until the emperor’s death and the rise of the Third Republic, the empire would stagnate, as the Emperor did nothing, and the Lords often fought among themselves.",
                        "#### Purge of the Unworthy & the battle of Deverssigus ~83374\nThe Purge of the Unworthy is one of the most notable events in recent EOD history. It served as a rejection of Sith Belief and cannon as the dominant truth and ushered in a new age of dispute on direction, which for many is considered a welcome breath of fresh air. However, there is still much stigma associated with those who were involved in the purge, both by other Knights and those within the Order who were not purged but also did not support the purge or leap in with full force.",
                        "The purge itself involved in an internal revolution on the planet Deverssigus. The planet had long been a stronghold of Sigmarist belief within the EOD. By whispering in the Emperors ear, the Sith who had retaken control of the EOD were able to get permission to purge those who refused to affirm the ‘correct’ beliefs of EOD Sithism, starting with the large Sigmarist cult on Deverssigus. ",
                        "When the Sith Knights attempted to arrest all Sigmarists who did not convert – and kill any who resists – the Sigmarists responded by sending out a message for help to the rest of the EOD, and then attempting to hold the world, and system, on their own.",
                        "The battle in space was bloody, long, and painful. The Sigmarist fleet launched lightning raids on the larger Sith fleet, destroying key ships are every turn, attacking supply fleets to prevent reinforcements and supplies from getting to the ground, and even in one case destroying a moon to prevent a fleet transporting several superheavy siege weapons from reaching the planet. ",
                        "On the ground, ever meter taken by the Sith cost 15 lives, to the Sigmarists 1. The villagers joined their Sigmarists knights, committing terrorists’ attacks on Sith patrols. When the Sith Knight Commander made it known that any village caught colluding with the Sigmarists would be destroyed, the villages, towns, and cities responded by issuing statements affirming their adherence to Sigmoria and permitting open street sermons whenever Sith Knights visited.",
                        "After three months of constant, hourly, bloodshed, when only the Greatest Sigmarist Knights, the wounded, and those too old or too young, or too inexperienced to fight, were left to defend the Temple, a fleet of supporting knights entered the system. Not just members of the EOD, all professed loyalty to the Empire, but claimed that the Sith had gone too far, violated to many ancient and sacred rights, and most importantly had violated the sacred fraternal brotherhood of Knights. The Sith were forced to concede, step down from control of the EOD, and any who participated in the Siege of Deverssigus were banished from the Brotherhood and Order.",
                        "Following the battle, the EOD recalled all members from the field, and began to hold summits, interviewing all members and weeding out any who did not meet the new standard of purity – the defining trait of which was a sense of selflessness, devotion to the Empire, and to the Civis.",
                        "#### Post Civil-War Reforms ~83376\nWith the worst elements of the Order purged, and the civil war behind them, the EOD turned inward with a focus on healing and repairing the damage. Over the next 5 years the major school of thought would shift from the Modern Sith thought to the Classical Versian thought which had been dominant in the First Empire. This taught a focus on supporting the Empire and being agents of the Empire. The dominant belief returned to the classical goal of the EOD serving as the standard by which all other Knights should desire to live up to.",
                        "There was a noticeable shift away from focusing on economic prosperity and one’s own wealth, back towards the value of one’s honour. Service to the emperor decreased, but service to the Order became much more important. The Order also worked to strengthen its members abilities to argue against corrupt or otherwise distrusted lords. The Mages Guild was brought in to review members and confirm that the religious beliefs were inline with Guild teachings. This was important as in the pre-purge period the religion of the EOD became God-through-science and that one could achieve godhood through understanding science, a belief which was at the heart of Sithism. Thus, while Sithism as a science was still allowed to be taught, as the Order did not believe in supressing science, Sithism as a religion was banned.",
                        "The outcome of this period is the three-core oath of the EOD: the Oath of Knightly Service, of Service to the Gods, and of Service to the Mages Guild. The first because members of the EOD were now to be the exemplar Knights for all others. Your honour is vital and is gained by fulfilling your obligations to your liege, your serfs, your order, and above all your fraternity. The second was affirming that you held God-in-Science beliefs, and not God-through-Science, and thus denying the Sith religion its place in the Order. The third and final Oath was to the Mages Guild, as the Empire was seeming to return to something akin to the First Republic, the Mages Guild seemed a useful ally to draw closer to, and the recent help in the purge solidified the relationship.",
                        "### Third Republic ~83381-83390\nThe Third Republic was brought on by former Kinder-Fuhrer John Hellsbeck, having fled the United Federation of Earth following his attempted assassination of the just elected Fuhrer Emily Goodwin. Having fled to the Vers Empire, he began to whisper in Emperor Henry’s ear, and eventually was granted the title of Lord.",
                        "After the public announcement of the Emperors death, and Knight-Commander Camilla Vers Allussya taking up the title of Lord in Command (of the Emperors fiefs). This started the Third Republic period, as Lord Hellsbeck and Lord in Commander Allussya battled each other for control of the Empire, while causing great harm to those who lived within it.",
                        "#### Reaffirmation of Service to the people ~83381\nWith the lack of Emperor, and renewed sense of purpose, and general changes, the EOD was ready to reaffirm that its goal was to serve the people. While this would contradict their later role in the defense of the Palace from the People, at the dawn of the Third Republic, the EOD was focused on repairing the empire for the people, bringing food to those who needed it, and dealing with various extra-planar issues as they presented themselves. The Knights returned to their position as exemplars of what the Aristocrats should be, as well as what the Militorious should strive for. They also continued their focus on reforming and rooting out corruption within themselves.",
                        "#### Defense of the Palace from the People ~83389\nFollowing Empress Camilla gaining the fealty of most of the Lords, thereby becoming Empress. Now President Hellsbeck desired more power then had initially been agreed upon. He called one final, great, assault on the palace by the people. Each previous attack had been devasting to the people, but also to the now Empress’ PR, and the President hoped that by smearing her image with another of these attacks he could force her into conceding some terms, especially the ability to hold both the title of Lord and President.",
                        "To do this he rallied the starving masses as best he could, telling them on the night of the Empress Coronation Feast, of the grand meal taking place within. Telling tales of Debonio; Celestius which riled the crowned into action.",
                        "As the mob encircled the palace, the troops out front ordered the crowd halt their advance. After two warnings were given, smoke and tear gas were deployed. In response, Hellsbeck planted provocateurs opened fired on the guards, quickly turning the entire mob hostile. The hoard rushed towards the guards who opened fired on the crowd, hurling bullets and grenades into the weak and starving masses, while Hellsbecks agents within the crowd distributed void/Energy/Vibro/chain-axes/knives/hatches/swords and whatever other melee tools they had gathered. While others in the crowd were given pistols and sub machine guns, some laser and others with plasma-cartridges.",
                        "Within this fighting there were many EOD in attendance, both as guards and knights of the Empress, and those with other Lords and guests at the dinner. When the fighting began to turn against the guards stationed outside. The Empress ordered her Knights to assist.",
                        "The EOD among them realized their best strategy for fighting a mob was to create one of their own, and got to work casting spells, animating suits of armor, rifles, drawing skeletons to life, or building new creatures entire, an army was raised and send to help defend the palace from the crowd outside.",
                        "The Knights did not stop there, on the front lines Knights were quick to draw their void blades and make liberal use of plasma-grenades. With the EOD’s spells, including raining balls of frozen hellfire, that upon contact would freeze the persons skins while burning their blood cells, and knights on the battlefield, supported by their raised armies of creatures, the tide quickly turned towards that of the guards. The Knight and their hoard however did not let up, and until the crowd had broken down into its smallest cells and completely petered out, groups were hunted and killed. In the days after, those who were thought to be working with Hellsbeck were killed.",
                        "This hurt the Knights image with the Civis, but much of the damage was offloaded onto Hellsbeck. Following his suicide/murder by his successor Lord Libcivius after losing the Presidency, his title, power, the KinderFuhrership, his family, and everything else, it was unveiled by his Knight-Commanders the extent to which he had been behind several of the largest riots on Versarius and was indirectly responsible for much of the bloodshed that had ravaged the empire for the past ~10 years.",
                        "### Fifth Empire ~83390\nThe result of the Third Republic was the ascension of Camilla to the title of Empress by swearing of fealty from the Lords in the Collossius, in exchange for Lord Hellsbeck renouncing his title, trading it in the for resurrected title of President of the reborn Citadel, now in a more equal power sharing agreement with the Collosius, briefly establishing a bicameral legislative system. This system would be radically after only a year of being in place, after President Hellsbeck lost his title, and the Citadel moved to a purely advisory position to the Collosius, beginning the Fifth Empire.",
                        "In the short time since then, Empress Camilla has declared a new Era of Colonization, the first step in her plan to move Vers forward, away from the Empire of the past and towards a new and glorious future. Among her other actions, she has begun to reach out and work with Guilds, Corporations, and other rights-holding bodies to help them as best she can. She has also requested the EOD assist in dealing with extra-planer threats, rogue mages, and other internal magical issues.",
                        "#### Oath to the Empress ~83390\nWith the formal return of the Empress to power, and her professed goals to help the people of the Vers Empire, as well as numerous back room deals with the Equites Ordinis Orbitals and Equites Oridinis Deorum, she was able to gain their favour and support in this period, as indicated in the Oath to the Empress being pulled out of the Abyss to which it had been damned due to its association with Emperor Charles and given new life by the new Empress.",
                        "With her generally positive message, her background – having renounced her families name and claim to the throne to enlist in the Militorum as a Civis. Then working her way through the ranks during the Great War, earning herself the title of Knight and Joining the EOD. Forcibly transferred to be under her mother’s control, she did not stop fighting for Vers even during and after her mother’s death. She earned her place as a Knight Commander under the Emperor during the Civil War and watched with her disowned Father as her half brother murdered her Emperor and full brother. Under the restored Emperor she was instrumental in preventing the Emperors personal war against the Communist Empire of Deutschland, by personally poisoning her depressed but seemingly immortal father, sending him into a coma from which he would never awake. Then working with the other Knight Commanders until she was the primary Knight Commander and could assume the title of Lord in Commander, thereby giving her the perception of having earned her title of Lord and Empress as a Versian, even if only, at best, a quarter Versian by blood, and in all probability with only the tiniest fraction the ancient royal blood.",

Their primary goal has become hunting extra-planar entities: from demons & devils to daemons and mutant madmen, fallen or misguided Angels and Gods whose wrath when incurred can destroy planets. Not counting that the past thirty years of trouble has led to massive upheavals among the Civis, and an exodus of Mages from the Guild, now forming cults or otherwise practicing rogue magic.",

                        "-	#### Equites Oridinis Daaponbellot: Knightly Order of those who fought in The Great War\nThose who fought in the great tend to hold a more positive view of the EOD. They tend to respect the drive to enter into the war and defend those at risk, or advance the glory of the Empire, or due to the general sucess of the Empire in the war as a whole. Overall, those few Knights who lived through both the Great War and Civil War tend to hold a higher view of the EOD then those who only lived through the Civil War, though both conflicts left few and even fewer survivors respectively. ",
                        "-	#### Equites Oridinis Dommonan: Knightly Order of the Treasury\nThe Knights of the Treasury tend to view the EOD as an extravagent expense. The Empire spends an exborerant amount of money on the EOD and its Knights, while rarely seeing them return much profit. But then again, the Treasury hates most Knightly Orders.",
                        "-	#### Equites Oridinis Domelis: Knights in the Order of the Army\nMost Knights tend to come from the Army, and so have heard many stories of the heroic and awesome deeds of the EOD, as well, many of the EOD's members also served in the Army and are part of this Order, which fosters an even greater amount of support.",
                        "-	#### Equites Oridinis Navstellaris: Knights in the Order of the Navy\nFar fewer Knights are of a naval background. Like Knights of the Treasury, the Navy tends to bundle within themselves, and while they have members within the EOD, and generally are more positive towards the EOD then the Treasury, the groups within still tend to be fairly insular cells. ",
                        "-	#### Equites Oridinis Civum: Knights in the Order of the Civil Service\nThe Knights who manage the Empire in the Background have grown to dislike the EOD since the dawn of the Third Empire. As the Sith further sunk their teeth in, and the EOD shifted back towards warfare from their old path of public help/works, the EOC has grown to dislike the EOD, though they don't outright hate the EOD just yet.",
                        "-	#### Equites Oridinis Emparor;: Knights in the Order of the Emperess\nThe second most elite of the Knightly Orders, the EOE and its Knights are those who are most devoted to the Role of the Empress. Unlike the Orbital Knights, who are chosen by the Empress and are the highest of all Knights in the Empire, the EOE is an invite only group of those who are devoted to the Versian Pantheon, it is also known as the Cult of the Empress. They are almost all members of the EOD, or hold very supportive views of the EOD. ",
                        "-	#### Equites Oridinis Domempareor: Knights in the Order of the Lords\nFormally the Order of the Lords are those who would like to work closely with the Lords and support them, similar to the Order of the Emperess. Informally however, the Domepareor is the Witcher safehaven after the Sith took over the EOD, and has remained that way following the Purge. It considers itself an informal rival to the EOD, and is lobbying the Mages Guild to support it in a future bid to the Empress for the Rights to practice magic seperate from the EOD.",
                        "-	#### Equites Oridinis Vetthronis: Knights in the Order of the Old Thrones\nThe Knights who are part of titles within the Milky Way Empire or whose titles can trace their roots back to those in the Milky Way. Generally speaking these Knights are not fans of the Modern EOD. It is an unspoken branches within the Milky Way preach modern heresies, but due to the distance, and legal issues with corexea status with the UFE, these issues are quietly ignored. Thus the two groups view eachother disfavorably.",
                        "-	#### Oridinis Comequites: Order of the Mixed/Shared Knights\nThe Order of Knights who are have multiple titles/are shared by multiple lords. They tend to hold a pretty moderate view of the EOD, many of its members also served in the Civil War, but many of its members are also new and have very positive images of the EOD.",
                        "-	#### Equites Oridinis Dacivis: Knightly Order of those from the Civis\nThe Knights of those who used to be civis. They tend to view the EOD negatively. Many feel that in the time since the First Republic, the EOD has abandonded the civis for their own gain. For this reason, these knights tend to hold negative views of the EOD.  ",
                        "-	#### Equites Oridinis Ebellos: Knights in the Order Against War\nThe pacafist Knights Agree with the Treasury, Civil Servants, and those from the Civis that the EOD does not do enough good, and that it has become a tool of war which should be disbanded. THey are oftne the most outspoken in their distain for the EOD.",
                        "-	#### Equites Oridinis Coreos: Knights in the Order of Courtship and Love/Seduction\nThe Knights of Courtship have long had a distain for the EOD, it comes from the EOD refusing to teach or supply Courtship members with spells or potions which would help them in their various jobs/roles. This has developed into a small but vocal hatered for the EOD, though some EOD members do join the Courtship Order. But even when they do, theri spells and potions are reserved for themselves, due to EOD rules. ",
                        "-	#### Equites Oridinis Commercon: Knightly Order of Traders\nThe Order Of Commerce and Trade's dislike of the EOD is relatively recently. Following the Purge, and the Wars, the EOD's members generally started cleaning up their game, and while many have not done much to help the Civis, many have also not done much to help trade. This has led to those Knights who still actively try in trade to desperately try and get help, which the Treasury has supported, but the EOD's members tend to focus on less, due to their various other obligations, especially to the Mages Guild.",
                        "-	#### Equites Oridinis Inquisis: Knightly Order of Detectives and Investigation\nThe detectives tend to have a large overlap with the EOD, as the two's areas can benefit eachother greatly. For this reason, the Magic Knights and Detective's tend to work closely together, and the two groups have a very high and respectful view of each other.",
                        "-	#### Equites Oridinis Legvealienis: Knightly Order of Ambassadors/Diplomats\nThe Diplomats tend to hold a favorable view of the EOD, for two major reasons. First is that most Knightly diplomats view the world through a lens of tools to be used to reach a goal - within that lens, the EOD is very effective. The Second reason is that the EOD is great for propaganda. Many across the Known Universe know of the EOD's deeds and at least vague stories of these Knights. The Federation Void-net is filled with videos and mental-impresesions and knowledge packs on the deeds of the EOD. The two factors when put togther make the EOD a very effective tool in an ambasadors arsenal.",
                        "-	#### Equites Oridinis Imperium: Knightly Order of the Servants of the Empire\nThe Sevants to the Empire, or Knights who fufil the various roles and offices of Imperial Governence, tend ot hold an all togther positive view of the EOD. They are seen as valuable tool for keeping the peace, both through the enforcement of peace through violence, and through diplomacy, and magic. There is a large cross-over between the EOD and the Servants of the Empire.",
